Network State is a concept introduced by Balaji Srinivasan that describes a digital community that can eventually become a physical nation. Key concepts include:

1. Cloud Communities: Digital communities that form around shared interests, values, and goals.
2. Network States: Cloud communities that organize to collectively act in the physical world.
3. Recognition: A network state achieves diplomatic recognition from existing states.
4. Crowdchoice: Community members vote on decisions and governance.
5. Technology Stack: Cryptocurrencies, digital identity, and other technologies form the backbone.

The Network State vision involves starting online, building community, and potentially acquiring territory to form sovereign entities recognized internationally.

Q: How does a Network State differ from a traditional nation-state?

​The first in a series of NS hackathons! For the first iteration, we're going to start short and sweet with a 1-day mini-hackathon. All skill levels are welcome, and we'll also do some beginner workshops and mentoring before the event for people who want to skill-up beforehand. (see Alex's AI Mind Meld luma events, and ping @spaceprincess if you'd like some more help getting comfortable.)

​The theme is likely to be ""vibe coding"": making things with 99% AI, so you actually don't need any coding skills. Welcome to the future. We'll also have mentors to help as needed!

​Judging: @yashluna, @jacksonofalltrades, and other surprise guests have kindly agreed to be on the judging panel! Some of the things we'll be looking for are originality, relevance to the NS community, and future-orientedness.

​Preliminary schedule:

​12 noon: everybody gathers for quick intro meeting, learn about judging criteria, prizes, q & a, etc.

​~~ hacking ~~

​5 pm: hacking complete, everybody gathers for presentations and celebrations

​6 pm: dinner!

Daily Mental Reset (Evening) - Aum (Om) Chants,"Saturday 8 March

Prastut Kumar",VIP Lounge 7 - 13th floor,https://lu.ma/ely7spx0,"​Reasoning -

​The sounds aa, oo, and mm activate three different chakras in the body (aligned to areas near the stomach, heart and throat) - which inturn allows energy to flow within and through the body seamlessly. Immediately after, sitting in silence while focusing on the area between the eyes, allows us to feel the difference in energy flow and reset accordingly.

​Helps with feeling grounded and at ease, while going through regular daily activities.

​​Looking forward to seeing you :)

​​PS - Luma doesn't allow recurring events - I'll keep updating dates on the same page for now

​Cheers!"

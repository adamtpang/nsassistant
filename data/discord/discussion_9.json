(in future expand to other important research areas, have a tokenomic structure to incentivise participants, let labs, scientists build on our datasets, etc.)\n\nwould love to have your thoughts @undefined on how we can proceed in making this happen - i will also book an office hours session shortly to discuss at length how i can contribute to this vision."

    "content": "This can be a delicate topic, but still think it's worth mentioning:\n\nMaintaining a Body Mass Index (which is related to your weight) between 18.5 - 25 is associated with a lower risk of heart disease and diabetes. So, paying attention to your weight may be of interest if you want to remain disease-free for longer. And it may be better to be in the middle-lower end of that spectrum than bordering on either side of it. You can use ChatGPT/Perplexity to get a BMI estimate.\n\nAn important qualifier: for many people, paying too much attention to weight can lead to serious psychological issues. You'll need to be honest with yourself to evaluate the trade-offs and decide whether or not you're in a place to pay attention to your weight healthfully.\n\nAlso, some people take issue with BMI as a metric broadly (it's a single metric, originally developed using a reference class of white men, etc). But to be honest I think the basic point - your weight is a relevant variable in health outcomes - still stands broadly.\n\nThe book \"Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy\" is my reference here. If others have better sources I would love to read them!"

Would you be able to help us run one of the standard models so we can programmatically generate our own images?\n\nIf my understanding is correct it's *possible* to programmatically get images from Midjourney, either via [Discord bot API](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1cc9ax2/comment/l4iyhva/), trying to access Midjourney's private APIs, or using one of the unofficial Midjourney API services ([1](https://www.imagineapi.dev/), [2](https://www.apiframe.pro/)). But it might be easier to run our own model if you already have that skillset.\n\nAlso, in general ‚Äî is it reasonable to expect we can get comparable results to what we've created from one of these open source models without any fine-tuning?"

There has been some discussion here <#1282669934970802268>.\n\nThe \"easier\" version is to use an existing API (something like Warpcast API or Dune Analytics) to get all the data you need and then just focus on building the visualizations.\n\nThe \"harder\" version involves writing code that downloads all the data from the Farcaster network yourself, and then making that data available to an app that creates the visualizations. Will avoid going into details here, but this is a significant amount more work than making an API call to something like the Warpcast API. The upside is that your end application will be able to render the visualizations much more quickly."

He used:\n- [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/)\n- [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/features/ai-photo-editing/)\n- [Magnific](https://magnific.ai/)\n- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)\nWe're going to go over his process in-depth at some point.\n\nBalaji also seems open to making a request to Peter Levels about getting hints on how we can reproduce a PhotoAI*-ish product in-house or, more simply, get something like an \"enterprise license\" so we can just use the tool for each person. I think that's a last resort after a bit more exploration on how we can create a streamlined-but-no-fully-automated process without PhotoAI.\n\nSvetlana thought it would be quite a manual process to use Photoshop to create filters that blend photos with the background photos we created with Midjourney. She thought each photo would need to be touched up individually with that approach, and that one template wouldn't work across individual photos. She encouraged trying to find an AI tool that would just automatically do some consistent sylization\n\n*Context: The prototype I shared contains an AI-generated photo of Carla (via PhotoAI). The benefit of trying to use something like this is we can ensure a standardized style, posture, etc. across the photos."

There‚Äôs already been [a thread about an NS reading list](https://discord.com/channels/900827411917201418/1285431369631141911). Balaji said a hard cover of The Network State is on the way. Stripe Press publishes books that are [ideas for progress](https://press.stripe.com/). Balaji references about a book a minute. Bryan Johnson has books on [Zeroism](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/Zeroism-by-Zero), [Don‚Äôt Die](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/DONT-DIE-by-Zero), and even [some fiction](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/We-the-People-by-Zero). This list goes on-and-on and can cover ideas on creativity, spirituality, history, economics ‚Äî everything! \n\nThe idea came from trying to solve my own problem: I would love to be reading for the last part of my wind-down routine, I would love to avoid screens, I love physical books, I don‚Äôt want to order/pack-in a bunch of books to NS.\n\nv2 bonus points: accompanying QR codes for each book where you can get a digital download (ebook, audiobook), community discussion for the book. Maybe NFT for submitting your analysis and contributing to discussion?"

    "content": "# Day 4 Quest: Using OpenAI Code Interpreter for Data Analysis\n\nHere is a csv of data about all the major cities in the world, pulled from nomadlist in 2021.\n\nToday we will be using the Data Analyst GPT to code for us and parse through this csv.\n\nGo to https://chatgpt.com/g/g-HMNcP6w7d-data-analyst to load the data analyst GPT. This is a chatgpt version with a \"code interpreter\", which lets the LLM run python code on it's side, to run various functions. The LLM thinks about what to do, makes code, runs the code, examines the results, and then decides whether it is done or if it needs to fix its own code and try again.\n\nFrom the Data Analyst GPT, upload the csv file. Your first prompt is:\n\n\"Load this csv into a pandas df and examine the head. Then print out all column headers.\"\n\nThis is a good first step into giving the LLM insight into what kind of data is in the csv.\n\nNext you will work with the AI to determine what city is best for you. 2nd prompt is:\n\n\"Ask me 5 questions in one message about my preferences for cities. I will respond to all messages. Then you will use this information to create a scoring system to score the cities in the dataset by these criteria. Finally you will run the scoring system on the dataset to determine what the top cities are for me. You will output a csv with the top 20 cities for me by this scoring system.\"\n\nThis should give you some output csv. You probably want to Work with the AI to improve the scoring system, because it's first draft of the scoring system might be a bit off. When done, tell the discord chat what your top 3 cities, and maybe a comment about the kind of things you prioritized.\n\nBonus for those who want more coding: At the end, ask the AI to output the code it used, then run the code locally on your own side or in a replit.\n\nTips: You may want to work with the AI on it's scoring system to normalize the data."

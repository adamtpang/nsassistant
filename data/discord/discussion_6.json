    "content": "Hi Everybody,\n\nSo with the Water being off Monday I‚Äôm thinking of taking a 2 day trip to Singapore and going to Universal Studios, I‚Äôve not booked it yet but I‚Äôm thinking leave Monday around noon get to hotel checked in 3pm and enjoy Monday night. Tuesday 10am Universal studios for the day until 5pm then head back to FC after 11am checkout on Wednesday.\n\nUniversal Studios Singapore Link\n\nhttps://www.rwsentosa.com/en/attractions/universal-studios-singapore\n\nTuesday 29th October Opening Hours 10 AM - 5 PM\nAdult day ticket 83 SGD\n\noptional Express queue skip, ONCE per ride 90 SGD\n\nHotel, I‚Äôm split between these 2\n\n¬£250 2 nights twin on Sentosa\nhttps://www.booking.com/Share-drDlz7\n\n¬£140 single room 2 nights on Singapore near Sentosa monorail and walkway\n\nhttps://www.booking.com/Share-ekAxVq\n\nUniversal studios is on Sentosa island, there's a covered air conditioned walkway from Singapore approx 0.4 miles long and a monorail that connects to the metro network, or grab works too.\n\nThere's also the only poker room in Singapore on the island, its 5/10 or 10/20 SGD. I fancy playing for a few hours just to get the vibe but It‚Äôs got super high rake and crazy local rules so I really really wouldn‚Äôt recommend anybody else plays it unless your are willing to lose a few k on a technicality.\n\nPoker Room review link\n\nhttps://www.poker-in.com/sg/casino/resort-world-sentosa\n\nSo if anybody wants to split the twin room or join for the Tuesday at Universal or the transport to/from Singapore or the whole lot I‚Äôll start a thread and or you can DM me."

I think it works by taking screenshots, reasoning over them and then taking actions like mouse/keyboard clicks. They also announced a new smaller model (Haiku 3.5) which is supposedly better than their previous largest model (Opus) while being much faster.\n\nIf you're looking for ideas about what to work on, this might be an interesting avenue to explore. It probably isn't amazing right now, but it will get better quickly. Also, if you're a solo developer or small team, this might be a workable v1 of outsourcing code to an agent ‚Äî either via a separate computer or while you're afk. Worth a shot!\n\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet"

Best to order individually to avoid complications at customs.\n\nSide-note: Ordering to Singapore costs slightly less than ordering to Malaysia. If you have a physical space or friend in Singapore you can order to and think the tradeoff is worth it, then go ahead.

Crypto exchanges have a lot of the same problems as banks, because they are banks. \n\nOnce you get set up in crypto, I find it works.\n\n My crypto wallets never make me call my bank to verify a bunch of info, or tell me that I can't move my assets. Banks do. \n\nMy crypto wallet never asks me for an ID and makes me wait 24 hours. Banks do. \n\nCrypto wallet has also never asked me for a proof of residency document from my home country even though I don't live there. Banks do. \n\nSo, I empathize, but it gets better after the initial hurdle."

I don‚Äôt own any USDC/USDT yet, so I figured to check in which wallet I can hold it. I have Solflare and Metamask, and as you all already know but I didn‚Äôt I can only use the Metamask one. Tried to deposit cash on Metamask but the page it opened looked a bit sketchy so I figured I can buy USDC on Bitvavo and then transfer to Metamask.\n\nSo next - deposit money to Bitvavo, all good, convert to USDC, all good. Then transfer to Metamask, not good, had to verify my Metamask account first by transferring ‚Ç¨0,01 from my bank account, okay done. Then Bitvavo had to verify the payment, okay, fair. Note that by now I‚Äôm about 10 minutes in, Bitvavo verification took about 20 minutes. Once done I transferred the USDC to Metamask which cost me ‚Ç¨2,20, opened the wallet, hmm no USDC there, ahh takes a while to transfer. Open Bitvavo again: 'processing', this has been the status for 45 minutes now. All in all took me more than an hour, and didn‚Äôt even get to the actual buying of a smoothie.üòÖ \n\nSo my experience ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt feel very user friendly but maybe I am missing something, please tell me if I do because I really want to try to see the use of crypto for these practical things and enjoy those delicious looking smoothies.üòÅ  I am also wondering how this will progress going forward, it seems to me that if more of the services within NS will be dependent on crypto payments it might not be very practical and crypto-newbies like me might struggle. Also, this is most definitely not meant as criticism towards the smoothie bar, but more a genuine wondering.\n\nCurious to hear other views on this! üôè"

This reduces administrative hassle and encourages accountability (can be tracked with QR codes).\n\n**Meal Reservations:**\n2- Require people to pre-book meals by a specific deadline each day. This helps with logistics by forecasting demand, ensuring less food waste and better stock management.\n\n\n**OPTION 2: Tiered Subscription Plans**\nIntroduce multiple subscription tiers to meet the varying needs and budgets of residents.\nExample\nBasic Plan: $35 for 5 meals\nStandard Plan: $50 for 5 meals\nComprehensive Plan: $150 for 5 lunches + 5 dinners + extras (like snacks or pudding)\n\n***I strongly think that people will be better at staying on top of their payments if these credits or plans are paid upfront with a scanning system that can take the burden off people to even remember, keep note on paper on paying for individual meals or figuring out how many meals they have left from their meal plan.***"

I am about 80% of the way finished and would love genuine feedback going into the evening as I wrap everything up. Don't hold back. (Better to fix something now before I publish it.) Also, understand this is a last minute request and the article accidentally turned into an absolute mammoth so no worries if no one is able to take a look.\n\nQuick context: I was running personal finance workshops for some family members and didn't have time to finish this summer before I left. The inspiration for this article was to fit the entire curriculum I had planned into a single article. This was a harder task than I initially suspected. \n\nHere is the link (with comment access):\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/15J_3ypVhU8VXOrt-6Aa4IYnpH44ZrzqZ--pDKFdDSiA/edit?usp=sharing"

My intent is to potentially return in January. Nonetheless, these last two months have been incredible and you all have taught me so much. The NS team truly picked some phenomenal people for this first cohort, and I met some I will consider lifelong friends and business partners. The collective wisdom and intelligence radiating throughout this school and movement is palpable, and I feel inspired every time I think about it. My hope is that we meet again in the flesh sooner rather than later. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Man, this is a bittersweet farewell. \n\nIt is time for the next adventure!"

On the other hand, to be fair, it is still a significant global network and been seeing some network society friends able to communicate with mainstream professionals effectively on it, in ways that help this movement be understood and liked by professional communities in ways that mainstream journalism fails. One friend, for example, is building a network society whose members are primarily 40 and above, and Linkedin is arguably still an effective medium for his communication."

    "content": "The case for being there is understandable, yet could it possibly be that NOT being on LinkedIn will be a NET WIN for NS - ‚ÄúLinkedOut‚Äù over LinkedIn? Think so. Let me for a second oppose NS having much of a presence there - why:\n\nLI is at this point an ATROCITY to humanity (or a net atrocity, if we recognize all the good things about it haha):\n\n1) The way LinkedIn is set up and the nature of their user base encourages affectation/appearing to be something over actually being, and has played its part in forming a culture of meritless status and show-off over substance and earnest work. Surely this is a generalization, there are earnest people on LI, but there are too many that don‚Äôt seem so. Would think such a platform doesn‚Äôt deserve our presence or attention.\n\n2) A minor thing that is telling of the spirit of this platform: The LI profile page format is ‚Äúvertical‚Äù, as if one‚Äôs work/life is a ladder from one thing to another. It‚Äôs a subtle thing, but I‚Äôve personally seen its subtle strong grip on the minds of many otherwise promising people. Anecdotally, I have friends that admit thinking all too much on how their next move is going to ‚Äúlook‚Äù on their Linkedin profile, which is sad. One could say it‚Äôs their personal weaknesses that are at the roots of this, but still, LI amplifies them. I wouldn‚Äôt want to fuel such a platform.\n\n3) Many great people (surely not all) have left it already, never joined it in the first place, or almost never use it. Could say not being there is a a luxury for the particularly privileged, but would argue it‚Äôs a luxury we as a community can afford because we can recruit and spread the word in more powerful ways (1 to 1, Twitter, etc).\n\nWould therefore say not being on LI is actually a NET-WIN for NS - we lose out a bit on reaching many at once, but we gain more by our absence from it, and by simply inviting our friends directly 1 on 1?"

Think of it as decentralised AWS (compute, storage, database, networking). Founder is ex coinbase, and Dev at farcaster. Fair distribution only for miners, no VC or presale or ICO. wQUIL is available to trade on Uniswap. Bridge is live again. Mainnet is now live with a few challenges that come from distributed infrastructure but it does get managed and worked on well. I haven't had a chance yet to understand how to deploy dapps there. Early miners seem to be done dumping their tokens. Consider this a good project to look at. Currently at 0.13$, with people buying in 100k USD tickets below 0.10$. ATH was about 0.40$ and I think this can be much bigger. My target is 1$, 1 billion MCAP.\n\nCatalysts:\n- Adding GPU capabilites to ride on AI wave\n- Coinbase listing very likely due to Dev relations and holding presentations about QUIL at Coinbase."

There were suggestions for a bounty board to be created/used in Discord (or built natively on NS, perhaps with a Slido-esque upvote feature). There were also polite requests made to the team to share more about what they‚Äôre working on each week so that folks can plug in when they know they‚Äôre needed (just like how Valentin was able to help tackle the mold operation because of his experience in this area). Give us some cycles to figure out what works best.

They had a successful kickstarter for their quantum compute simulator. It simulates 30 qubits so you can talk to it like you can with a real quantum computer. The computers can easily provisioned, become part of a cluster and a quantum crypto coin project is using them for mining quantum resistant crypto. So could be an edge to offset the hardware cost of 400$ (less than 0.2 ETH or 3 SOL). It‚Äôs like a raspberry pi for quantum compute or NVIDIA Nano for GPU/cuda learning and comparable investment thesis as buying a Solana phone for airdrops. \n\nMy sysadmin will be able to deploy software and provision the ‚Äûpucks‚Äú. It‚Äôs in line what he‚Äôs working on anyway with decentralised compute. As mentioned in my lightning talk ‚Äûa cloud for the cloud people‚Äú this could be a rather easy entry to get something started. \n\nIf that‚Äôs interesting let me know and I can grab a few more. Plus they actually look kinda cute."

    "content": "When Apple announced their partnership with OpenAI, Elon was quoted as saying that he won't let any iPhones in any of his companies. Since then he has elaborated on why he doesn't trust OpenAI and Sam Altman in particular. However, Apple has been releasing research on their plans for how they can have queries sent to LLMs in the cloud in such a way that they can prove mathematically that the server has specific software on it that doesn't allow leaking of data, and this article seems to be another facet of their strategy so that they can plausibly claim that AI is not spying on users.\n\nWhile I don't use an iPhone, I think that their research here is very positive, because it will force other software providers to follow suit. Otherwise, they can be painted as villains who are spying on users. Various Android manufacturers will need to follow suit if they wish to capture the privacy focused market (businesses, governments), although they may struggle to do so without Apple's resources."

    "content": "From chatGPT \"Senator Cynthia Lummis's proposed \"Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act\" outlines the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States. The bill specifies that the U.S. Department of the Treasury would be responsible for managing this reserve through a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin vaults. These vaults are mandated to adhere to stringent physical and cybersecurity protocols to ensure the highest level of security for the nation's Bitcoin holdings. \nLUMMIS.SENATE.GOV\n\nWhile the bill emphasizes the importance of robust security measures, it does not detail the specific custody mechanisms, such as the use of multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets or the involvement of third-party custodians like Coinbase. The focus is on self-custody by the Treasury, utilizing secure vaults under its direct operation.\"\n\nSo it looks like US Gov self custody, probably something like a big multi sig with several redundant physical keys, total guess but say 11/15 multi sig 9 people and 6 geographically unique locations in bomb proof bunkers.  Keyholders could be designated people like fed reserve chair, VP or custodians like Coinbase, Cantor fitzgerald or companies like Casa.  Alternatively they could custody at 1 or more custodians like Coinbase etc  Or they could hold ETFs.  The Sovereign wealth fund could also be a backdoor way to hold BTC too, ETFs, MSTR, Miners etc\n\nIt needs to be done right, USA level they have the technical know how to do self custody properly, UK/Australia Gov level I wouldn't trust them, Custodian or ETFs for them.  I think nation state adoption is a foregone conclusion I just hope my Gov isn't the one that fucks it up and gets all the others to do it properly.\n\nI've also heard rumours the US Marshalls holding the 200k Silk road BTC are a mess, spreadsheets of the private keys and awful sounding stuff, they may even have lost it already."

Hilton members are just consumers, while **NS citizens can also be producers**.\n\nThe network state also mentioned that fiat countries can often tamper with history, but population or data statistics through blockchain cannot be tampered with. \n\nSo I have an idea to **count NS‚Äôs GDP and create GDP on it.**\n\n@undefined  counted the current GDP(onchain part). \n\nI really hope to discuss how to increase NS‚Äôs GDP and write the business development history of NS together. \n\nMaybe start by selling/buying a mango with crypto at Marina hotel and displaying the GDP of NS members in real time."

On the other hand, \"Insert XYZ-Nation-State First\" politics and ideas are becoming more indoctrinated/institutionalized, decoupling and de-globalization is becoming the norm, paving way for a more late 1800's Wild Wild West with tariff wars and other rising nationalism. \n\nI look forward to learning from you and co-exploring hopefully ways in which our kids could thrive in this world through better education and openness."

Sometimes, parents choose to move abroad for fun or work, while other times, people are forced to relocate due to political circumstances, leaving them with no other options.\nTCKs form a highly diverse group, yet they share a common identity as individuals who have developed connections with different countries, cultures, and mindsets during their formative years.\nI am sure NS will be full of TCKs. üôÇ"

There is also the care to make sure that patriotism does not slide into nationalism (it's sometimes a slippery slope). Then there's sometimes the conflict or struggle when a host country's ethos/national ideas -- ones that may be indoctrinated early in schools -- go against the home country's ethos/national ideas.\n\nI grew up partially in Miami, with many school mates who had families from places such as Cuba and Venezuela. Sometimes I would wonder how my Cuban/Venezuelan school mates balanced between their home country's roots and their host country's politics/ideas, which continues to sanction/blockade/denigrade their motherland. (Then again, Castro was perceived negatively, so maybe that helped tip the scale.) \n\nMy wife's grandmother was at one time Malaysian Chinese from Penang. The Malaysian Chinese for decades struggled to balance this: cast away/abandoned by the 1950s-1960s PRC Chinese state as de-facto foreigners, but also disregarded by 1950s-1960s Malaysian state sometimes as 2nd class people (Singapore was born partially because of this!). For a while during mid-20th century, there was a struggle to keep Chinese language schools alive in Malaysia, while kids grew up under a national education policy that was intended to reduce this culture. (It was more extreme in Suharto's Indonesia, where at one time the national indoctrination was to force kids in the Chinese diaspora to take up new names and be forbidden from cultural expression in public places.)"

I will be at NS May 1st. \n\nYour points about being Third Culture Kid resonate alot. I guess many of us -- or our children -- have felt like a Third Culture Kid at some point while growing up. It's a struggle when most nation-state-driven narratives try to indoctinate kids on loyalty to flag/national hero/national story etc as early as possible (that probably also includes most SE Asia public schools aside from international schooling or home schooling).\n\nRe: Legoland. They have three parks: the main park, an marine park, and a water park. There are rooms and/or kiosks where kids can almost spend an entire afternoon building stuff."

Ideally it is a flight ticket leaving the country (most convenient are services like onwardticket.com or sth. cheaper is booking fully-refundable flights), it could be a train/bus/<anything> ticket leaving the country via it¬¥s landside border, or even a hotel reservation. But it always kinda depends on the person that is checking,  what they accept.\n\nDuring my time traveling, I once wanted to use a bus ticket and had to discuss it with the airline (first, they did not want to accept it and deny boarding). Since then, I just always booked an onward flight (which I cancelled for a full refund after immigration) because it is always accepted."

It's always good to see kids at an early age develop curiosity to scientific discovery, technology acceleration and problem solving.\n\nThe part that's been a pain point (open question) and arguably more controversial is around the social science and humanities aspects that eventually pop up. For us adults, many of our social and national ideas were shaped at an early age by the narratives that dominated our early education.\n* Arguably, religious indoctrination could feature heavily in some form early on. I am not saying that's bad...as religion stories teach kids morals and other good things, but early indoctrination also shapes kids' minds in binary forms.\n* Arguably, nationalist indoctrination could also feature heavily very early on. Nationalist stories could be packed and indoctrinated into the minds of 4-5 year olds. These stories and sentiments are hard to shake off, even when the kids grow up into rational adults.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that most nation states require that their schools have kids as young as 4-5 years old stand in front of a national flag every morning and sing a national anthem. It's early indoctrination at an early age that will stay with the kid throughout his/her lifetime.\n\nAnd we see this eventually manifested in how many of our leaders and congressmen/women eventually treat the world as black/white binary."

Sure, these comparisons are not absolute. There is a Yin vs Yang...Yin most of the time but with bit of Yang; Yang most of the time but with a bit of Yin. On movement: that's a good point. We are already seeing Trump's USA and PRC moving to converge somewhat in terms of being tech-nationalist-capitalist-mercantilist. The Network State movement (it being a movement) would be moving too.

I hope to join everyone here to contribute to this effort!\n\nLooking forward to learning from everyone here in this group!\n\nHad my eldest son visit Forest City during the last 1-2 weeks of NS v1. He really enjoyed Legoland. I recommend getting the annual pass that's good for three parks -- it's a good deal given that NS is about 15 minutes Grab taxi ride from the parks.@undefined and I had also done a playdate for our kids during the end of NS v1, that was cool.\n\nBoonsri has been organizing the amazing Startup Kids' Club.

One could argue though, that the US tends to culturally fall more under Individual Agency hemisphere whereas China tends to culturally fall under Cooperation hemisphere. Two of the biggest superheroes / cultural icons illustrate this:\n\nIronman (USA): Tony Stark is the embodiment of self-made success, intellect, and individual willpower. Despite not having inherent superpower, he transforms himself through individual agency and technology. He constantly innovates, refines his technology, and refuses to let governments or institutions dictate his role as a hero. He believes in individual action and self-determination as key winning factors.\n\nSun Wukong (China): Wukong is the embodiment of enlightenment through order and collective potential. Wukong begins as an arrogant, rebellious figure who challenges Heaven itself, defeating celestial armies through sheer might and trickery. But instead of becoming a self-determined hero, his arc is about learning humility and cooperation‚Äîhe is ultimately tamed by Buddha and embarks on a journey to India where his power is placed in service of a greater collective purpose. His fulfillment comes from understanding his place in the grand order of things."

Both models --- tech capitalist nationalism and tech capitalist globalism --- could co-exist for a long time. \n\nUSA: \"America First\" political directive, tariff weaponization (at expense of Canada, Europe, etc), protectionist policies toward domestic manufacturing and prioritization of American tech/innovation at all costs\nChina: Rare minerals weaponization, identification of national technology champions in key technology sectors (autonomous vehicles, clean energy, AI, robotics, semiconductors, etc)\n\nAmerica under Trump and CCP/CPC under Xi are very similar in ideology and practice:\n* Both stress strong nationalist culture and revival (Make America Great Again vs Rejuvenation of Chinese Nation)\n* Both emphasize traditional family values \n* Both are anti-woke\n* Both favor transactional pragmatic foreign policies\n* Both weaponize trade\n* Both put priority on national security and secure borders\n* Both spur anti-corruption drives\n* Both support key national technology innovation\n* Both see value of transformative technology entrepreneur leaders (Trump with Elon, Sam, Zuck, Jensen, etc....Xi recently with Liang Wenfeng, Ren Zhengfei, etc)\n\nOpponents of Trump may call Trump \"fascist\", opponents of CCP/CPC may call it \"communist\", but in essence both are really just tech nationalist, arguably two sides of the same coin.

However, this was just one of many factors, including industrial output, strategic alliances, and technological advancements, that led to the Allied victory. - https://x.com/i/grok/share/VsuvTsurixCHB1CncixIbypj7\n\nso, those Axis soldiers (those that weren't in charge) were very good at doing exactly what they were told, but without explicit orders they were often powerless. so, they were completely dependent on good leaders and good luck (ie if something went wrong, they were effed). \n\nso, those ideas, applied to entire societies, rather than just militaries, is what I think Balaji is getting at."

Many thanks to Balaji!\n\nA guess (open to my being wrong, as it is a guess) is that the ‚Äúconcern‚Äù arises because the results achieved that garner respect could arguably be attributed to nation-state-level directing of whole-of-society cooperation (as opposed to agency of a network, or agency of individual founders). (Though one could also argue that the cooperation model is partly a function of Confucianism that also influences places like Singapore, Korea, etc‚Ä¶so it is not singular to that one particular powerful Far East nation state).\n\nThat said, open question: I wonder if potential wisdom in the Indic/Dharmic texts could offer ways to explore a harmonic co-existence between highly individualist agency in a Western technocapitalist model and a high societal cooperation Eastern model? The Indic wisdom accepts multiple deities and multiple truths, and emphasizes harmony. \n\nThe Indic/Dharmic and Sinic/Confucian also arguably share many similarities, as wisdom flowing from the Ganges via Buddhism had for centuries also been assimilated in Confucian ethos. For much of the first millenia, the Indic and Sinic ideas also arguably intermingled with the Western Indo-European through the Silk Road and other routes."

There were both tech optimistic and dystopian views.\n\nTech optimist ‚Äî AI could create abundance by liberating humans to chase self-actualizing dreams, unleash new creativity, etc etc\n\nUltra tech optimist ‚Äî AI could fuse with humans to form human-machine hybrids in some trans-humanist future\n\nDystopian ‚Äî AI could be centralized in the hands of few oligarchs or nation states who control narrative while the masses, freed from needing to produce, indulge in endless entertainment fantasies enabled by AI (Playstation -> TikTok -> AI enabled entertainment)\n\nRegarding silicon intelligence, there is arguably another form. Our current known biology and biological intelligence stem from carbon-based organic chemistry. Carbon, with four valence electrons that facilitate bonding, serves as a basis framework for known life on Earth-like environments. The next element further down the periodic table with four valence electrons is silicon. Suppose somewhere in the universe, under a very different and more extreme climate or environment, it is silicon, not carbon, that serves as a basis framework for life and intelligent life? Silicon-based lifeforms and alien intelligence."

A bad actor would have to develop it in secret at scale and not use it for anything else until they could hack say the top 1000 btc wallets in a day. Then btc would have to do nothing about it. A fork with better encryption and maybe rolling back those quantum hacked transactions would be trivially easy and likely get consensus in that situation.\n\nIt's a mammoth task to just get it working, doing it in the shadows with only dark money under constraints like only the scientists a state can kidnap into a manhattan project is just super unlikely. More likely is Google get it to the point where they have built one that could theoretically hack satoshis wallet in 2 years. Then btc preemptively changes the encryption. \n\nIf quantum became scalable and powerful at breaking encryption quickly with some discovery all the encryption before btc sha256 would get hacked first. Picture a scenario like Mr Robot season 1 where all the banks records are hacked and everybody's dms are leaked. So your wife knows your cheating, your mum has seen ur dick pics and there's no record you owned those MSTR shares anymore on the plus side there's no record you owe the bank that mortgage."

    "content": "Dear NS alumni,\n\nGreetings in the Year of the Snake üêç! Today is Chinese New Year's Eve, the night before the Lunar New Year celebrations begin. On this special occasion, Chinese families gather for reunion dinners, set off firecrackers, and put up Spring Festival couplets to welcome the new year üéä .\n\nAccording to the Chinese lunar calendar, this is the Year of the Snakeüêç. In the Five-Element theory (Wuxing), \"Yi\" corresponds to the Wood element, which is associated with spring and symbolizes vitality and renewal. As we enter the Yisi year (the cyclical designation for 2025), the prevailing Wood energy brings a sense of springtime rejuvenation, as if the world is being draped in fresh greenery. In Chinese culture, the snake embodies wisdom, mystery, and transformative power, while also representing adaptability in the face of change. This suggests that both our external environment and personal circumstances may undergo significant transformations in the coming year.\n\nAs we embrace the Year of the Snakeüêç, I wish y'all inspired creativity, graceful transitions, and delightful discoveries throughout this dynamic period. May your new year be filled with prosperity and joy!"

Hope there is more constructive discussion and debate.\n\nTrump has arguably been doing some really good things for American people who prefer less federal government overreach, and his administration is very much more preferable for pro-tech, pro-crypto, and libertarians in America. \n\nThat said...this is wild. Trump could have had potential to win a Nobel Peaze Prize, instead of alienating Europe, slapping fellow North American neighbors with 25% tariffs (there are only two other big North American neighbors!), and now antagonizing significant Latin American nation states. At least Spain (in the name of God), Britain (bringing 'civilization') had created surface level narratives for imperialist / colonial expansion...as opposed to blatant takeover rhetoric (Greenland, Panama, Canada). The rest of the world won't just roll over....even if certain far-right politicians in some countries favor Trump, their voters will likely vote \"XYZ is not for sale!\"\n\nFor pro-tech and freedom-loving Americans - Trump could be good.\nFor USA the nation state - Could be scoring own-goals. A nation state with significantly-higher-than-global median age, ~4% global population and 15% of global GDP adjusting for PPP probably cannot afford increasing divisions at home and alienating allies, partners, Global South, and competitors all at once abroad.\n\nWould love to hear comments and discussions on Reza's ask. One early hypothesis of a post-US financial order (one of many potential views) could be going back to the 1870's - 1890's (so no order actually):\n1870's - 1890's USA: Rise of oligarchs, expansion of domestic manufacturing and industry, increasing exploitation/banishment of immigrants, continued expansion of new frontiers.\n1870's - 1890's world: Increasing inequalities, mercantilism, great power games, rampant unchecked colonialism, and rapid tech advancements.\n\nPost-2025 USA: Dominance of tech oligarchs, return of domestic manufacturing, curbs on immigrations, expansion of tech frontiers.\nPost-2025 world: Increasing global inequalities, erosion of international bodies toward more mercantilism, great superpower games (and possibly Bitcoin being a part of power games to stockpile), unchecked power grabs by various ascending powers, and rapid tech advancements."

    "content": "Good to hear from you Mili! To build on the discussion on shaping of narratives...\n\nArguably, one of the key reasons for Tiktok ban in the US is that the establishment is unable to shape narratives on TikTok. To borrow a Balaji term -- it doesn't have root control over TikTok.  \n\nArguably, the Great Firewall of the East was also erected in part to stabilize narratives. Though there is a technical difference: if a tech company complies with Chinese laws, it can operate inside the wall (whether those laws are perceived as stringent is a different discussion). Many Western tech giants made a conscious decision to stay outside the wall. In TikTok's situation, it has made efforts to comply with US laws (whether those efforts are perceived as sufficient is a different discussion), while the establishment made a conscious decision to ban/force sale regardless.\n\nWhether it is firewall or ban/ejection/forced sale, the action creates a digital barrier to make it easier to shape/enforce mainstream narratives. But time and time again, we see that the network's organic, grassroots strength could prevail. What makes the recent situation interesting is the direction of flow...it's as if the East German establishment originally made the wall, but the West Germans are so fed up with \"West German\" propaganda that they break the wall and go to East Germany this time (and find that \"East Germany\" is actually in some ways wealthier). For a moment in time, there is a conjuring of that image where East Germans and West Germans celebrate a common humanity without artificial barriers or enforced narratives from either side's propaganda.\n\nThe issue of how narratives are shaped is arguably very relevant to NS and network society movement. We are already seeing a relatively negative mainstream narrative (for example, previous BBC article, etc) that is being slapped onto us. Reading that BBC article, it almost feels like a mainstream narrative was already pre-determined to be slapped on -- in that vein, it was arguably smart for the NS group to not engage with mainstream media too early and to not play their game with their rules. Digital barriers make it easier for those negative mainstream narratives to stick longer. But the organic, grassroots power of the network would prevail eventually.\n\nInteresting observations Mili made regarding various popups. As with the crypto movement, there is going to be diversity: BTC, ETH, SOL, etc. We have Balaji + NS (BTC), Vitalik + Zuzalu (ETH), etc. Then at some point, we have the memecoin equivalents for network societies/popups?"

NS was much more BTC, right & money vibes whereas all other zuvillages I've been too are ETH, left & impact vibes.

Balaji had previously during his lecture astutely made an insight about history being in reverse. Here is another recent example:\n\nIn the 1950's and 1960's, the East erected and guarded a wall in Berlin against supposed Western influence, while thousands of people from the East tried to flee and seek refuge in the West by breaking through that wall.\n\nIn the Internet era, a Great Firewall also exists, while it is the West that is now becoming increasingly concerned about alleged Eastern influence (e.g. recent TikTok ban), and hundreds of thousands of Internet users from the West (especially Americans) are now organically trying to flock to the Internet of the East through apps like Xiaohongshu / RedNote (which ironically is literally named after \"The Little Red Book\" of communist origin).\n\nTimes change. There is a breaking the \"Berlin Wall\" potential to this Xiaohongshu / RedNote development. Few people saw this coming. People are wondering how long this organic network-driven breaking of digital barriers erected by nation states could last. If it lasts, there could be major lessons and takeaways for the network society movement.\n\nhttps://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1879459953112645773"

Ya AISTR I got kicked out of their telegram group for telling them they needed to sell the FDREAM in their treasury, which they were up huge in at the time, to buy more cbbtc ha. I sold it after that for a wash. Recently bought a smaller position back cause I feel retarded for making the chart but would feel even more retarded if I sold it all and it still pumped in future ha. Anyway it's like 1% on my crypto holdings so will hold it till it dies or has its day in the sun. I am 35% TSLA 35% IBIT 25% TRAK and small 1-2% positions in MSTX (2x MSTR) CONL (2x COIN) and CRML in main stock account. Also picked up MSTR in my retirement accounts recently. I think markets have a nice rebound from here into mid Febuary. Looking forward to Mr. Trump getting the big axe again in a couple days."

I'm doing my due dillegence and messing about with a very small % but this is going to be fun as I can trade this leveraged product tax free I think I'm going to have a bash at actively trading a small bag with it.\n\nThe CPI print came in below expectation and it seems to have been positively received by macro, btc and MSTR so that sets us up for an exciting weekend. David Sacks is holding a crypto ball on Friday night with saylor as special guest ahead of the inauguration on Monday. If sentiment stays positive on macro that frees bitcoin up to do bitcoin things leading up to the inauguration. \n\nJust now I think 80% chance we don't get a strategic bitcoin reserve day 1 or it's something poorly received like just the already seized funds with no extra buying or pro crypto policies. However, I'm expecting some rumours to surface about what trump will do day 1 after the ball and I think there is definitely 20%  potential for day 1 being somewhere between a nice pump in btc to something obscene.\n\nGame theory says don't announce until they have bought but there's also a case for them wanting to signal they will deliver their promises on crypto.\n\nOne last thing, these usually amount to absolutely nothing of note but this Friday a very large amount of MSTR 1-2 year old options expire deep in the money. If they have hedged as they should it will be a nothing but there's a small chance of a short squeeze on MSTR. The MSTR price movements have been insane this last year so it's very possible lots of people thought the current scenario was impossible and they got caught offside, we will see on Friday if we get a pump."

I always thought the saying, ‚ÄúShow me who you‚Äôre with, and I‚Äôll tell you who you are,‚Äù was just that‚Äîa saying. But the past few months at the Network School have completely changed my perspective. Meeting brilliant people from all over the world has shown me just how true this saying is. I feel like I‚Äôve gained so much insight and wisdom and have become a better version of myself.\n\nBeing around kind, intelligent, and hardworking people truly transforms you, and I can confidently confirm this from my own experience. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for the opportunity to call such amazing people my friends and to have had the chance to learn and absorb so much knowledge and wisdom.\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who‚Äôs made this experience so magical. It has been an absolute honor to be part of the first cohort. I will cherish the memories made and the knowledge gained here forever. Here‚Äôs to becoming faster, better, and stronger! I can‚Äôt wait to put everything I‚Äôve learned at the Network School into practice and come back for V2. We are truly living in exciting times. ü´∂"

A big thanks to Balaji as well as Jackson, Donovan, Jonny, Jacob, Yash, etc the NS organizers; to Boonsri for organizing Startup Kids‚Äô Club; and to 150 incredibly talented v1 NS members for an amazing living community and meaningful conversations!\n\nWill respect the vision Balaji has in mind for the future. After applying to NS, I initially could only make logistics work during first two weeks after Network State Conference, but really missed this, so came back for the full last month after finally making logistics work. Probably many of us would hope that this is a beginning of journey and not an end‚Ä¶and we would love to come back for v2 to continue contributing to a part of the collective journey as NS scales from 100 to 1000 to 10000 and more. \n\nWe are all also online and in the cloud. The end of v1 doesn‚Äôt mean the end of this community or our discussions. Hoping we continue to stay in touch on Discord and via online conversations, etc.\n\nThe movement is also multi-generational. It was really good to see kids coming in. Thank you Electrik Dreams for our kids‚Äô wonderful playdate. I wanted the young son to be exposed at a very early age to new paradigms. Hopefully we will have a future generation of Netizens.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays! üéÑ"

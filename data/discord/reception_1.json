(A brief intro to be updated on nspals, pls @athon) \n\nI work as a lawyer, specializing in assisting and advising tech companies play nicely with regulations while still keeping their creative spirits intact. Currently, I'm working on a groundbreaking case - the first ever filed before the High Court in India addressing copyright infringement by AI developers for their training data.👩‍💻\n\nMy core skills revolve around researching complex issues and presenting concrete, actionable steps in a simplified manner. I enjoy making complicated concepts accessible and finding practical solutions to challenging problems. 🤝\n\nWhen I'm not working, I enjoy playing ping pong (I'd say I'm pretty decent at it!). I'm also a badminton enthusiast - if anyone has racquets and shuttlecocks, I'd love to challenge you to a friendly match at the nearby court.🏓🏸\n\nI'm looking forward to engaging in meaningful interactions with everyone here during March 2025 and exploring opportunities to break into the tech space.🎙️\n\nExcited to connect with you all!"

I am grateful for the continuous opportunity to learn from everyone at Network School and to network. My intro (for NS pals)\n\n👷 Professionally: Consulting, infrastructure/transportation, agribusiness, and more recently in education.\n\n🌏 Network state/society community discussion participation: 1729, Plumia discussion groups, Network Society Camp, TNS Connect Writers, Network School v1, etc.\n\n👨‍🍼 Personally: Raising two young sons who I hope become Netizens.\n\n📖 Areas of interest, research, and hoping to learn:\n* How the network could enable us to transcend nation state boundaries and identity stack. (The nation state through passports/national ID/SS # define our identity stack from birth to death…could that change?)\n\n* How network societies could become multi-generational and develop more innovative educational paths. (I hope my sons and others in their generation continue the momentum to grow up and be educated as Netizens.)\n\n* How network strength could help diaspora communities survive amid geopolitical tensions and fearmongering. (As Chinese-American I worry about Sinophobia & McCarthyism/yellow peril narratives like what happened in Indonesia in 1990’s; anti-Chinese diaspora sentiment on the rise in Philippines where I am based.) \n\n* Tech, AI, blockchain/crypto/BTC, astronomy/cosmology, history, and life extension"

For the past three years, we’ve been living in Bali. 🌴 \n\nOriginally, I trained as a lawyer and worked in television before having kids, mainly in international program acquisitions. Then, in 2013, my husband founded MrCoin, Hungary’s first Bitcoin exchange, and I was involved in that journey as well. <:bitcoin:1282286965794017280> It was incredibly exciting to introduce the then-unknown concept of Bitcoin to Hungary and to help build and educate the community around it. We organized Bitcoin film festivals, gave talks, and produced the Bitcoin segment for Hungary’s most well-known financial radio show weekly for many years. One of the highlights of this journey was unveiling the world’s first Satoshi statue in Budapest, which has since become a global symbol of Satoshi. We’re very proud of that! Fun fact: the statue was originally planned to have a hat, I was the one who convinced the team that the statue absolutely had to have a hood. 🙃 .  \n\nI’m not a tech person by nature — I’m more interested in how technology and society influence each other. This applies to both cryptocurrencies and AI. I’m not so much focused on what happens at the code level, but rather how these innovations can be used for the benefit of humanity, maximizing their positive impact while minimizing potential risks. ❤️ ☮️ 🫂 \n\nI have a deep passion for working with children. 💗 🚸 As a UNICEF volunteer for years, I helped run interactive workshops on children's rights and the realities of kids living in different parts of the world. I’m a Third Culture Kid (TCK), and my sons are as well, so I have extensive experience—both as a former TCK myself and now as a parent—on what it means to grow up across multiple countries. I understand the advantages and challenges of this lifestyle and how to enhance the positives while mitigating the difficulties. I even wrote a children's book on this topic, which won the \"Children’s Book of the Year\" award in Hungary in 2024. Additionally, I run educational Facebook groups in Hungary on topics like TCK kids, as well as women and AI. I am the co-founder of an indie book publishing company in Hungary called Zazie Books.\n\nBeyond this, I have a background in journalism, political analysis, mediation, and coaching. I’m currently furthering my education to specialize in coaching children as well. 👩‍🎓 \n\nMy father was a member of Hungary’s first freely elected government after the fall of the communist regime, which gave me a deep insight from a young age into how a traditional nation-state operates. This, along with my legal background, makes it fascinating for me to rethink the role and function of the state from the ground up. This is one reason why I find NS so exciting. My husband and I also share a goal of creating a space, school, and workshops for the children of NS residents — ensuring they can grow and evolve alongside the adults. After all, while we’re trying to figure out what the future will look like, they are the ones who will live in it the longest, so I believe it's essential to involve them in shaping it. 🚀 \n\nI have no harmful addictions—unless you count books, movies, and contemporary art and architecture... 😊\n\nI’m really looking forward to getting to know all of you and would love to chat and exchange ideas on any of these topics. See you soon! 🙂 😍"

Programming the new earth / heaven on earth economy. \n\nI moved to silicon valley when it was cool, at Apple ATG initially, later some startups, then left before it became uncool, was a digital nomad in Thailand, living the dream, mountain villa, wife,  2 kids, car - then ended up taking 3 years off on a spiritual path, sat with teachers and Gurus, became determined to reach enlightenment, meditated, found the most direct teachings, ended up in Bali without the ex-wife but with the kids which was / is epic, they are the best 😉 \nOne day, I became aware of reality - and that was enough for me and I got the message, back to work now! The next day, I was hired as CTO of an ICO play - it fell apart quickly, but I learned a lot. Then I worked on Seeds and Hypha DAO, a conscious currency and a DAO platform. \n\nI am very much interested in the idea of network state; it is very clear to me that society is collapsing, not fit for a new state of consciousness emerging on earth, and the vision was always to build the new earth instead of fighting the old. Been on this journey for 6 years now - it's going to happen. \n\nBurning man was my inspiration for what an utopian society can look like - everyone volunteers, everyone does what they like to do, and everything gets done synchronistically. A giving economy. \n\nBut before we get there on a large scale and in the real world, blockchain is our bridge - to get out of the money slave system and create peace on earth. Any currency that's not corrupted basically would do - but blockchain is a technology that just so happens to fit the bill.  \n\nExcited to meet you all on March 1st!"

I completed my bachelor’s degree in Melbourne, Australia, and over the past eight years, I’ve been fully immersed in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. As a serial entrepreneur in this space, I’ve had the privilege of building innovative projects from the ground up, navigating the highs and lows of this dynamic industry. Alongside my entrepreneurial ventures, I’ve also been an active investor in the crypto space, always on the lookout for groundbreaking opportunities.\n\nI’m thrilled to have joined Network School in March, and I’m deeply inspired by Balaji’s visionary concept of the Network State. I believe this idea has the potential to reshape the way we approach entrepreneurship, community-building, and innovation. It’s exciting to think about how we can apply these principles to create something truly impactful.\n\nFor me, entrepreneurship is all about turning ideas into reality—taking a concept from 0 to 1. It’s about solving real problems, challenging the status quo, and creating value for others. I’ve learned that success in this space requires resilience, creativity, and a willingness to learn from failures. I’d love to collaborate with like-minded individuals here to co-create, experiment, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.\n\nAt Network School, I’m looking forward to embracing the \"Learn, Burn, Earn, and Fun\" mindset. I’m excited to dive into the curriculum, contribute my experiences, and grow alongside such a talented and passionate community. Let’s build something meaningful together—innovate, hustle, and have a blast while doing it!"

Now, I’m focused on launching my own Tibetan incense brand and connecting with like-minded individuals to share ideas and grow together.\n\nI’m also deeply passionate about yoga and Vipassana meditation, which have been transformative to me. Vipassana is a technique that helps bring the unconscious mind to the surface. As Goenka said, there are three kinds of thoughts: one is like ripples on the water, fleeting and temporary; another like a line drawn on the sand, easily washed away by the waves. But the third is an imprint carved into stone, lasting through time. This third kind is what’s stored deep in the iceberg of our unconscious mind, secretly influencing our behaviors—what we often call fate. Practicing Vipassana has been the greatest gift of the past year, and I hope to share this experience with others.\n\nAlso! I’ll be in Mt. Gambier for a Deep Week to get my Wave 2 certification, so I’ll be in Sydney/Melbourne from March 12-24. Catch me for a coffee if you're around!  Can’t wait to meet y’all."

Mostly I like to work either as freelancer, consultant,  remote jobs or on my own products and research ideas.\n\nOne reason I am particularly excited about network school is because I believe this is how communities and even nations of future should work. Grouping people based on their shared values and interests makes so much more sense than grouping based on geographical location of birth. \n\nAlso, I believe that it's not just opportunity but also our responsibility to have a specific vision for the world we want to see when technology makes EVERYTHING possible because pre-internet era institutions won't survive post-AGI era.  IMO, one right direction would be to create a world of abundance and compassion for all biological beings. So far, it was Natural selection that helped in gene improvement but it also led to so much cruelty and suffering because it is based on scarcity of resources and zero sum competition. In world of abundance, we can just program genes and improve them in specific directions we want. All the species should be augmented with artificial intelligence and inter-species communication should be made possible so that planet earth actually becomes a much more healthy and happy place to live. \n\nSome projects I am exploring currently - \n- Possibility of test-time reasoning in spatial domain instead of just text domain.

    "content": "**What I’m currently working on:**\n\n• For the past 15 years, my focus has been on exiting the legacy system and helping others do the same—this is still ongoing and one of the main reasons I applied to NS.\n\n• Consulting, primarily helping legacy institutions onboard into crypto—setting up their entire Web3 financial stack (software, policies, training, etc.).\n\n• Learning a lot about AI—both top-down (user perspective) and bottom-up (math and first principles).\n\n• Beginner Muay Thai learner—would love to take classes at NS. Anyone else interested in learning or teaching? Boxing, Jiu-Jitsu, etc., are also on the table. Let’s connect!\n\n  \n\n**Network School**\n\nI’ll be arriving in April, and my first project will be setting up a microschool/homeschooling community to make it easier for families to stay at NS for extended periods. The model will follow the **2-hour model / Alpha School approach**, where kids learn autonomously with AI tutors at their own pace—without human tutors for the basic core curriculum.\n\n\nNext, the microschool would expand to afternoon sessions led by human coaches/mentors/motivators. Their role would be to help kids discover their passions, cultivate curiosity, and become 10x versions of themselves through human collaboration and AI. The focus would be on life skills, soft skills, and preparing for the future. The ultimate goal: involve kids in **building the future of society**—because it’s their future, and they should help shape it as soon as possible.\n \n\nI hope to bootstrap this as quickly as possible. If you’re interested—whether you’re bringing kids, planning to stay long-term, or want to be involved—please reach out!\n  \n\nI’ll be at NS in April, then taking a short break before returning in June/July and staying until the end. My plan is to get the microschool up and running quickly so my family can join long-term next academic year—and to make it easier for other families to come. There’s no society without families and kids, so this will be my top priority.\n  \n\nI should probably put this intro on a website instead of dropping this wall of text here 😅\n  \n\nAnyway, excited to be here!\n  \n\nAnd seriously—if you’re interested in the microschool or coming with kids, let’s connect.\n\nhttps://x.com/keo\nhttps://warpcast.com/keo604\n[linkedin.com/in/bdebreczeni/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdebreczeni/)"

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m Barnabas, originally from Budapest, Hungary. I grew up as an expat kid in Algeria and have been living in Bali for the past three years.\n\nI consider myself a builder, with a strong software engineering background—I started coding at five. I love solving problems that others think are unsolvable, with a strong emphasis on user experience. Growing up in Algeria and then in a post-Soviet country, I failed a lot and learned to crawl through broken glass to make it. I’m a cockroach, not a unicorn. A cockroach with a Liberland passport 🙂\n\nI’m excited to join the Network School because I rarely meet like-minded individuals who are extreme risk-takers, fanatically love reimagining difficult problems from first principles, and embrace, learn from, and enjoy all the associated challenges.\n \n\n**Things I value:**\n• **Human connections** – Honesty, Empathy, Love\n• **Self-sovereignty, Liberty** – NAP, Voluntarism\n• **Spending time offline** – Enjoying the analogue waves\n• **Building online** – Crunching digital bits\n  \n\n**Things I care about:**\n• The future of society\n• Posthumanism\n• Everything that can be derived from the above two:\n    • Detaching from the legacy system to become free, borderless, and crypto-native\n    • Building a new societal blueprint\n    • Safe superintelligence\n    • Health, safe food, longevity, sports\n    • 22nd-century education\n    • Preparing for what’s to come in the next five years - and what's to come after\n\n  \n**A few fun things I’ve done:**\n\n• Got together with a dozen people to create a community/village of like-minded techno-optimists. The project failed, but I learned a lot about biointensive farming—and it’s also where I discovered Bitcoin (this was in 2010). Back then, we used Bitcoin as money to trade veggies, land, labor, etc. No one thought of it as “HODL never spend digital gold.”\n\n• Bootstrapped Hungary’s crypto ecosystem—[founded the first exchange/brokerage](https://mrcoin.eu) (since exited), launched ATMs (with a highly ranked central bank officer [praising Bitcoin at the inaugural event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDvEgqsbZow)😅), organized educational workshops, meetups, etc. Fun fact: We have the longest-running [Bitcoin Meetup](http://www.bitcoinbudapest.hu) in the world!\n\n• Erected the first [Satoshi Statue](https://www.youtube.com/live/em74TdeSsbw?t=2363s) in Budapest, which became a pilgrimage site for crypto enthusiasts (and is now the default “Satoshi image” in the press).\n\n• Built a small GPU rig to learn about mining—and it ended up mining Ethereum’s [genesis block](https://x.com/keo/status/1272844823834308608).\n\n• Helped fund and bootstrap a pirate microschool/homeschooling club for my son 10 years ago because we couldn’t find any alternatives we were happy with. This later became a state-accredited [decentralized network of 18 microschools](https://budapestschool.org/en/) with 800+ students in Hungary.\n\n• Co-founded [Reaction](https://reaction.global) with Stanford Executive Program classmates—a VC fund focused on solving important problems."

I got a job in networking when I was 18, and have since graduated the University of Houston with a BS in Computer Information Systems. Somewhere in between there I learned about crypto (I will only answer the question “*how*” over a Moutai) and I’ve been hooked for nearly the last 10 years.\n\nIn my day-job, I work at a global accounting firm where I teach professionals why they need to care about crypto and how it works. I also am in the process of scaling our blockchain community. I love what I do, but I’ll be taking a month off of that to come see what the Network School is all about in July.\n\nAfter (*during*) work I also work on whatever side-projects I think would be fun, scalable, and make me a millionaire before 30 (I’ve got 9 months left). My favorite one right now is a Twitter page that automatically enhances and highlights AI art that I handpick, though it hasn't made me any money (yet). When I’m not doing that, I love to workout (actually hate it), walk in the sun, be at the beach, play basketball (big one), and win Marvel Rivals games (plat now, but just getting started).\n\nYou can find more about me at elijah.guru\n\nI can’t wait to see you all 🙂"

Excited to be here and looking forward to connecting.\nI’m Ursula O’Kuinghttons, and my journey has always been about stories, whether it’s interviewing migrants searching for a new home or Heads of State shaping the future. I started in journalism at Prisa Media (Spain), covering major global events and expanding media across Europe, Spain and Latin America. But in 2012, I became fascinated by the idea that technology, specifically blockchain, could rebuild the media industry, making it more transparent, independent, and resilient. That curiosity led me to ConsenSys, where I was a founding member of Civil, one of the first attempts to decentralize journalism. Later, as Director of Communications and Partnerships at the Web3 Foundation in Switzerland, I helped to launchPolkadot. \n\nNow, as CMO of Scytale Digital VC and an advisor to Project Liberty (Frequency blockchain), I’m focused on building bridges between technology, media, and business. Project Liberty recently made a bid to acquire TikTok in the US with the goal of decentralizing it. We shall see how that unfolds, but the ambition is clear: put control back into the hands of users.\nA few exciting things ahead: I’m organizing Decentralize Lugano, a finance-focused event in Switzerland, in May 8th, and I’ll also be at ETH Denver, where we’re hosting Frequency House, and Merge Buenos Aires, where I’ll be presenting a Web3 documentary on FC Barcelona, a project I’m proud to be part of.\n\nI”ll be joining the NS In August, I’ll be moving to Singapore with my 12-year-old son, and we’re both looking forward to this new chapter. \n\nIf you’re around at any of these events or in Singapore, let’s connect!"

Before that, I wrote a blog called Expat Nation, anticipating many of the ideas that Balaji advocated in The Network State.

Got two young sons who I hope to be netizens of network societies in the future. For much of my life, I’ve tried to as a neutral avoid collateral damage from the escalating US-China conflict, but the “curse” somehow always comes back — most recently in the form of nearly monthly South China Sea scares near the Philippines (which could rock the entire Indo-Pacific region) and fears of return of McCarthyism by US/US “vassals” (not so much about the “anti-Communist” part but concerns rooted in the potentially unfair and unethical targeting of particular minority disapora groups). \n\nI am thankful for the frameworks that Balaji has envisioned - for it gives me hope that milions of neutrals, nomads, migrants, third-culture-kids, etc can try to find peaceful independent alternate paths for themselves and their families — hopefully peacefully independent from clutches of legacy nation states that have power to commit violence, confiscation, cancellation, suspicion, persecution, and shaming of those accused of being not “nationalistic/patriotic” enough or accused of not loving “democracy” enough. \n\nHoping for a future in which my kids and others in their generation would no longer be judged or limited by the color of their passport/national id/social security card. (Nowadays, to be born, to go to school, to get employed, to travel globally, to get married, to have kids, to retire, and even to die and pass on inheritance — one would need recognition from a nation state!). Nothing against nation states, respecting them, just seeking peaceful alternatives.\n\nI look forward to learning from everyone — it is a blessing to connect with and learn from so many thinkers, innovators, entreprenuers, and aspiring network state/network society netizens in this community. I am humbled to have the chance to learn — and I hope to continue to come back to Forest City from time to time. A big thanks to Balaji and the NS team for making things happen. Cheers!"

Forty-something countries and 8 years later, I've done everything from running permaculture resorts to being a mermaid (long story 😅).\n\nGot into crypto many years ago — the early beginnings being a truly classic crypto story. Been working on self-custody stuff since because... well, learned that lesson the hard way 🙂\n\nI've lived in tons of communities along the way — seen the good and the bad, and excited to help make this one last."

Would love to have more time to dedicate to this though\n\nI've been in the crypto space for 3 years now and love talking about tech, society, opensource, monetary policies, history,decentralization. How do we create new decentralized platforms, new community currencies and in the end new states? I'm mostly aligned with the cyberpunk ethos so in this search for meaning in the crypto sea, I spent some time in \n\n - the ReFI (regenerative finance) space, trying to put a value on nature. I'm very interested in the food industry and how it could be improved\n- governance and more recently futarchy: governance by the markets. It's been a pretty interesting path of thinking for me\n- i'm learning about cryptography, zk and privacy. It's time to focus on this before everything is traceable\n\nI'm currently building an app called ascend https://x.com/ascend_sh : an accountability social network that lets you stake and bet on the completion of a routine or a task with your friends. Could be sport, pushing commits on github, twetting more, anything. It's still very early and we plan to launch soon, would love to do some user interviews with you guys. \n\nI could only stay 8 days sadly but it's already something and I want to take the most out of it. I'm super excited to see new things on the search for the network states and would love to find a way to contribute to it (agricultural projects to have good quality food, help building online tools, ...).

Did a disposable laptop company for China/Russia high risk travel, then moved to Switzerland when I joined a crypto foundation board and helped them to a top-10 market cap launch.

    "content": "Hello fellow NS admits!\n\nI wanted to formally introduce myself as I won't be able to attend the conference and the first 2 weeks - I'll be at a friend's wedding and will join you all on October 4. I am fascinated by Network States and grateful for the work the NS team has done to put this together. My FOMO is at an all-time high missing the first bit!\n\nI'm Shar from Vancouver. My entrepreneurial background spans multiple industries including agrichemicals, cannabis, real estate, entertainment, and some tech (an area I'm hoping to expand on). I've worked on pre-IPO capital raises, advised startup founders, and served on a co-op board (lots of parallels with web3). I thrive in project-based sprints, working with small, motivated teams to solve exciting problems. \n\nI'm coming off a six-year sprint building and exiting a cannabis company. The past year has been exploratory, focusing on new ways of work and refining not just what I want to work on, but how.\nThemes of particular interest: \n-Digital products and apps\n-Audience-first building\n-AI-driven low-cost development\n-Projects beyond excessive regulatory scrutiny -[as Balaji discusses regarding the administrative state](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvWMcRRkuak>)\n\nThese align with my belief that smaller teams can do high-leverage work (@naval speaks about this a lot -[see page 60 of the Almanack of Naval Ravikant](<https://navalmanack.s3.amazonaws.com/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_Final.pdf>). Long-term, I aim to build skills and a network for a venture studio-type model, creating tasteful projects for people with audiences (yes, this could be a DAO, my crypto friends).\n\nNS couldn't have come at a better time. Inspired by [Levelsio's 12 projects in 12 months](<https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/>), my goal is to collaborate on \"indie hacker\" type projects. Instead of solo development, multiple people with domain expertise building, testing, and launching projects quickly. See what fails or gains traction, focusing on building for or with an audience. I have a few projects I've been building with my own network but would be cool to build with some likeminded NS admits -would be extra cool to look at projects we could build for the NS community! If this interests you, feel free to DM me or start a thread. Looking forward to connecting!\n\nHave fun at the conference, everyone - I'll be watching online!"

In 2019, I founded China’s only homeschooler community. The desire to see the community achieve prosperity through emergence led me to explore organizational development, which is how I recognize DAO. Once my anarchist spirit met crypto, there was no turning back.\n\nOver the past five years, I’ve been involved in over 100 projects without attending college. About 30% didn’t fail, and 3% were a big success. Last year, as a digital nomad at Zuzalu, I began to wonder why college couldn’t be nomadic, prove yourself with portfolio instead of diploma?\n\nI tried to bring this idea to life with hundreds of co-creators and got $206,000 in pledged donations, but everything was shut down by the Political Security Bureau in China. I nearly ended up in jail. They feared the education for freedom and the infiltration through crypto investment.\n\nAfter that, I realized it was time to leave China and build on a global scale. So when I saw the Network School, I know it's where I should come."

I’m interested in absolutely everything but my favorite project right now is a suite of software that uses ML to evaluate seismic data and locate new oil reserves with ~90+% accuracy.\n\nI’ve traveled the world for the past few years and couldn’t agree more with Balaji’s vision for the Network State. We need to move beyond centralized states that maintain power through fiat, war-mongering, and sowing division. I envision a future comprised of sovereign individuals who maintain peace and trust through smart contracts and blockchain and increasingly democratize economic opportunity through innovation “in the world of bits and atoms” as Thiel would say.\n\nBalaji’s courage and foresight in organizing something of this magnitude is simply incredible. I will be in Forest City for all three months and intend to be a “more-than-full-timer,” investor, founding member, and just generally involved as much as possible.

Alongside this, I'm also building a new business with AI, exploring the exciting possibilities in this field. 🤖 But I'm very much a beginner in these areas, eager to learn from all of you who have such impressive backgrounds.\n\nOne personal challenge I've set for myself is marathon running. 🏃‍♂️ I'm training for my 4th marathon, aiming for a sub-4 hour timing. It's a goal I set 5 years ago and haven't achieved yet, but I'm using it as a way to teach myself persistence and not giving up on goals we set. Any running buddies?\n\nAt Network School, I'm here primarily to learn. I'm excited about the concept of network states and how we might create transformative projects, but I know I have so much to absorb from all of you. I'm ready to soak up knowledge about tech, entrepreneurship, personal growth, and especially about setting up new societies and governance models. 🌐🏗️ It's a fascinating area I'm keen to explore further.\n\nI'm looking forward to learning from all of you, contributing where I can, and growing together in this exciting journey.

My time in the corporate world was interesting, as I never had a fixed position within any company. I enjoyed problem-solving, so I eventually ended up becoming a consultant, helping manufacturing suppliers reduce scrap and meet OEM standards. \n\nAfter working in the automotive and Aerospace industries for 10 years, the pandemic accelerated my journey to become fully independent and finally broke away from the corporate world. Being an artist was always in the back of my mind, and Web3 introduced me to a new world where art and engineering are celebrated. I have been creating products and experiences in Web3 since 2021 and shipped my first game in early 2024. It wasn’t an easy journey, but it was something I needed to go through.\n\nMe and my wife (who was also accepted in NS <:newcountry:994308986578935958> ) run an Indie gaming studio and also create courses on the side to help creators break out of their shell. I am very excited to meet everyone and make new friends IRL."

I'm Milan from the Netherlands, also known as Mira Hurley on Twitter (it's a long story..)\n\nMy background is mostly finance and economics, having founded my own companies in the sector, worked for the Dutch central bank where I learnt just how slow-moving institutions can be, and having first encountered Bitcoin in 2012. Nowadays I'm a self-taught programmer, together with my co-founder we built NanoGPT which uses crypto to allow anyone, anywhere to access the best LLMs and image generation tools.\n\nThe Network School is genuinely the perfect combination of everything that I'm excited about:- crypto & AI are my main interests and fill my professional life nowadays, Bryan Johnson is the inspiration for our health protocol, Balaji's (and Patri Friedman's!) vision of the future of states is the kind of future I want to see (and help build) and since my girlfriend also got accepted we even get to do this together. On a sidenote we're broadly being declared crazy by friends and family for \"joining this cult\" since this is starting just after we got back from a 6-month trip through South America, but I'm super excited about it.\n\nI'm hoping we can make it to the Network State Conference in time. The previous one in Amsterdam was great so if anyone is doubting I can really recommend it. But if we don't make it to that, I'm looking forward to meeting you all on the first day of the program!"

I initially got into crypto when I was 15 because I wanted to start trading but couldn't get onboarded onto traditional brokers. I then learned about the permissionless nature of public blockchains and the ideology behind it, never left since. \n\nAt the end of my studies I then joined one crypto startup doing on-chain private credit, and then co-founded a portfolio management startup where I designed investment strategies based on on-chain data for token selection & rebalancing among other things.\n\nI am also quite interested in AI, and created some personal projects (one of which is an AI agent focused on summarizing student's slides and books to learn more efficiently). I decided to join the network school because I was at a point in my life where I figured I needed more personal experiences to know myself & where I want to go in the future better, and be able to learn from very interesting people from all over the world.\n\nI also love playing Frisbee (will bring one if anyone wants to chill on the beach durring the sunset), swimming, Music, and experimenting with new technologies\n\nI look forward to meeting you all!"

The highlight of my college experience was **building entrepreneurial communities** — I ran pitch competitions, hackathons, startup career fairs & art-and-music festivals. I also became **obsessed with AI** and, after graduating, I managed the first AI Index report at Stanford (https://aiindex.stanford.edu/).\n\n🚀  For the last 6 years, I’ve been **building digital products** with my friends. We participated in YC and have shipped 20+ products: “discord for work” (back in 2018!), a sleep coaching service, a capture tool (https://capture.so/), a wine tracker, and many more!\n\n**🎯  My intentions for Network School are to:**\n1. Be an engaged participant and active **community builder**, fostering an ideal environment for creating and sustaining global startups and communities.\n2. Develop my perspective on the most promising opportunities to **leverage blockchain as a social technology**.\n3. Be in the best physical, mental, and spiritual shape of my life. **Shoutout Blueprint**! Also excited to be around so many experienced meditators, I was not expecting that.\n4. **Develop new skills.** I’ve been learning-on-the-job for the past 8 years — I’m excited for a slightly more structured approach to “continuous education”.\n5. **Work on inspiring projects with amazing people from around the world.**\n\n**🔧 Things I’m interested in building:**\n**1. Personal Productivity Systems & Utilities.** I’m interested in structures that help people design-and-operate their life. From the lowest level todo lists to the highest level aspirations and vision boards. I’m still sitting in the question of how AI advancements can transform how we design our lives and get things done.\n**2. Blueprint.** Making any aspects of the Blueprint protocol more accessible to consumers.\n**3. Burning Man.** I’m coming fresh out of Burning Man and have some ideas. Is it possible to create a Blueprint-friendly Burning Man experience? Could blockchain-enabled devices / crypto-secured hardware be used to collect community feedback in a way that’s transparent and community-owned?\n**4. What are you building!?** Nothing gets me more excited than other people’s passion to bring something into the world.\n\nBroadly, I’m a pretty curious person. But to highlight some specific hobbies & interests: surfing, yoga, weight lifting, guitar, local-first software, tools for thought, consciousness, and community building. Would love to learn more meditation, dance, acroyoga."

Some say I’m half Viking half Sámi.\n\nI was never motivated by authority so I always found school quite boring. I still went to university studying computer science and business for a dual degree. It mostly felt like a waste though and I spent most time learning following my own curiosity.\n\nSince then I started a digital agency building POC for startups, developed a titanium-based DJ headphone used by top DJs like Diplo and Skrillex, co-founded a record label, built a cabin village in the mountains and co-founded a technology company developing AI models for automating valuation of real estate assets and opening up single-family homes at scale as a new asset class for institutional investors. \n\nSince my days in school I've been thinking about how demotivating the education system is. Academia is killing creativity and the joy of learning with its assembly line methods. I want to encourage students to dive straight into building at the edges of progress, without waiting for an academic diploma as a stamp of approval at the cost of your soul. I’m exploring a medium combining crypto, digital art, animated video and gaming, infused with our deepest knowledge. This is where my focus is now and Network States seems like the perfect place to apply it.   \n\nI like to read widely, produce (mostly electronic) music, design houses, take long walks and think about how the world works. I’m always drawn to the intersection of art and technology and learning about the frontier of innovation in various fields. My goal at NS is to meet like-minded people who want to replace dysfunctional institutions and build better environments for optimism to flourish. Happy to connect with anyone who resonates and thank you @undefined for making this happen. Looking forward to meeting and learning from you all!"

I always was interested in libertarian principles and looking for a truly meritocratic, free community.

Back then it was just one option on a long list next to paysafecard, VCCs, and prepaid cards, but crypto quickly became something I really care about for freedom and state-resistance.\n\nToday, I run Lendorse, a startup that helps finance talented but underprivileged students from developing and emerging countries to study STEM MSc programs in Europe. There is a bit of a cognitive dissonance, because I’ve become increasingly skeptical about Europe's future.\n\nI’m very interested in longevity. I see death as the final enemy and find it crazy how indifferent society is to it. I’ve started my own \"Bryan light\" longevity protocol, with regular blood tests and various supplements, but I still struggle with sleep discipline and maintaining a good diet and hope for the peer pressure of the program.\n\nProfessionally, I studied economics and business at LSE and St. Gallen.

Now, at 23 years old, I find myself living in Spain, which presents an interesting contrast to my background and beliefs.\n\n**|Current Projects|**\n**Building a decentralized water utility**\nI'm incredibly excited to be attending the network school with my partner. Balaji's network state thesis is at the core of my startup's vision: I'm building a decentralized water utility for network states, currently focused on Latin America. We aim to lower economic barriers to clean water access through reimagined core infrastructure and ownership models.\n\n(By the way, anyone have contacts in El Salvador? 😜)\n\n**EU/accelerationism podcast**\nLiving in Spain is conflicting for me. It's challenging being a pro-capitalist, small-government kind of guy in this environment. However, I've channeled this challenge into action:\n\n1. I've established a substantial chapter of the EU/ACC movement through strong local business communities.\n2. I started a podcast where we stream on X/twitter Spaces, amplifying voices from a network of local live players. We've already reached over 600 attendees in our first stream.\n\nI tend to sway pessimistic about Europe's current trajectory, but I’m determined to spark honest conversations about it and empower live players who can actually make a change. \n\n**|Personal Interests|**\nWhile I enjoy fitness, music, and playing guitar, above ALL I find myself irresistibly drawn to the mysteries of ancient civilizations, a passion that permeates every aspect of my life and intellectual growth.\n\nI'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and continuing to work towards innovative solutions in both the digital and physical realms. Let's reimagine what's possible together!"

I agree with Balaji in so many ways especially when it comes to future of the humanity, but it might take so many years or even generations for things to start moving (I guess that’s why we are learning to live longer or simply don’t die in this school)\n- Did my undergrad in the US and learned English\n- Previously a journalist based in Washington D.C. reporting on world politics\n- Switched to producing/directing stand-up comedy shows in China. Show biz in China is weirdly fun!\n- Now a full-time writer, also run a travel agency focusing on tours in South East Asia \n\nWhat I can provide to NS (just did a little brainstorming)\n- I make Chinese food and hot pot. If food is too healthy in NS, I’ll try to cook and share food. Not sure if we’ll have access to a decent kitchen, but we are close to a modern civilization (Singapore), so I’m sure we can figure something out\n- I take people to Bali all the time. I’m like half a local, so if you need tips/recommendations, hey (waving hands)\n- I directed & produced quite a few stand-up shows, podcasts & talk shows. I like talking to and interviewing people. And here obviously we see so many interesting people with fantastic life stories - I read through everyone’s intro and already have so many questions to ask. If you are also interested in producing something creative during your time in NS, let’s chat! Happy to exchange ideas / collaborate\n- I’m writing a novel and one of the main characters is a crypto bro. I’m still developing his back story.

I’ve been living a nomadic life for the past couple of years, mostly between Dubai and Bangkok. \n\nIn 2013, I quit my corporate job as a Mechanical Engineer with $500 in my pocket to travel the world and ended up in Toronto. That’s when I first heard about Bitcoin, and since then I got hooked and slid right into the rabbit hole. \n\nThanks to my degree, which is useless overseas, gave me the chance to explore and experiment with countless opportunities life has to offer, from waiting tables, bartending, real estate investing, and photography, to content creation and running my own restaurant, which got featured in multiple local Canadian media and became one of the top takeout spots in Toronto during the pandemic. \n\nI lived in 6 different countries (soon to be 7 with Forest City!) across 4 continents and visited 65+ countries/territories. I’ve come to realize that no country is perfect, it’s only perfect for you at a specific time in your life and (almost) all governments are the same. \n\nI’m heavily invested in Web3, starting with DeFi and then NFTs during the Pandemic. Together with my husband (who will also be attending NS), we launched an indie gaming studio specializing in Metaverse games and are also building an online learning platform.\n\nI’ve been interested in longevity since 2019, when I first read Dr. Sinclair’s Lifespan and have been using Bryan Johnson’s Blueprint products plus attending events like the VitaDAO DeSci Summit and the Akshay Summit in Dubai, where @undefined  was a speaker. I remember thinking, “Great events like this should be longer!” and here we are “The Network School!”  \n\nSuper stoked to join Network School to create, connect, collaborate, and contribute with all of you who share the same values, vision, worldview, and excitement for life!"

    "content": "Hey, I'm Faza. I'm a software developer building a decentralized code collaboration platform for open source development with my longtime friend and co-founder, Parth (he is also part of the program). I've always been fascinated by programming and its power to bring ideas to life. It's much more accessible compared to other careers where specialized instruments or capital are required for research. In comparison, we only need a laptop and an internet connection to conduct experiments; our ideas are the only limitation.\n\nI started working with Parth in 2019. I had just left my 3-year stint at a tech startup and was taking a break to learn about machine learning, blockchain, and other emerging technologies. I still vividly remember the first time I sat down with Parth as he explained the concept behind cryptocurrencies and their practical applications, convincing me to work with him. More than the financial and speculative aspects of cryptocurrencies, I was excited about the power to create micro-economies and incentives that could easily mobilize people across the world to work towards common goals. After that, we never looked back, and I've learned a lot both professionally and personally. In recent years, I've also been practicing meditation and improving my lifestyle for better health and slower aging. We have also been remotely working from Dubai, Bangkok and Banglore.\n\nI am really excited after reading through all your intros and thrilled to be part of this program and exchange ideas with all of you. I'm looking forward to lots of learning and making new friends."

So excited about this and meeting everyone!\n\nI grew up in the early days of the internet with 28k dial up and was mesmerized by the online forums, games, and the world it unlocked. I've been in the web3 space since around 2021 and have been coding since a young age. Big fan of open-source and building in public. Most recently I've been building funding platforms on Ethereum.\n\nI recently started a part-time course in business development with a focus on sustainability. I worked on a project that explored how the innovative funding mechanisms in blockchain ecosystems can be applied to humanitarian aid and funding of regenerative activities.\n\nJust read the Innovators (Walter Isaacson) and inspired by the way it portrays innovation as a team activity powered by cross-disciplinary skills so I'm hoping to explore some collaborations and learning from each other.\n\nI'm interested in expanding my skills in areas like AI, cryptography, digital governance, game theory, and applying them to today's challenges while keeping a keen eye on their future implications.\n\nAlso interested in healthy food, cooking, and wellness.\n\nLooking forward meeting you!"

I’m Hugo Faz, performance artist and filmmaker originating from grassroots queer communities, long time cultural agitator, anti-censorship advocate and art collector based in São Paulo, Brazil, fully involved with crypto and NFTs since early 2021. The moment I read Balaji’s announcement of the Network School I knew I was meant to attend, even before reading the term \"latin-american libertarians\"!\n\nSince getting to know and aligning with punk6529’s vision for an open metaverse, I became fully invested – time and money – in building our decentralized future. Not only I was one of the first Meme Artists to create for 6529’s project (https://seize.io/the-memes/30), I am also one of the biggest collectors of 6529's The Memes — which have just been revealed as the fundamental building blocks for a  practically functioning Network State — and among the highest reputed members of their network (https://seize.io/hugofaz).\n\nI have been collecting culturally relevant NFTs not just for myself but also for Casa NUA (https://en.nft.nua.casa), the southern hemisphere’s first permanent IRL Museum for Decentralized Art, which I founded in 2023 in the heart of São Paulo, and which now holds regular exhibitions of art minted as NFTs, culturally educating a new generation of artists, collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nBut besides all of the above, the Burn pillar of NS hit me even harder. Having my father diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s Disease in 2015 got me since embarked on a personal journey to optimize my physical (and thus my brain’s) health and gain as much longevity as I can to keep building and seeing flourish our shared envisioned future of peace, freedom [to transact] and knowledge. I have recently began using my social platform on Instagram  (https://instagram.com/hugofaz) to share this health journey daily and inspire others to do the same for themselves, becoming a health and fitness influencer of sorts, while also relying on my follower community to discipline myself. I follow Bryan Johnson’s achievements closely!\n\nEager to join the Network School and meet you all!"

Other hobbies include flying drones, reading, trading, hiking, swimming, kayaking, and gardening.\n\nArtists and digital nomads influenced my philosophy about work and purpose, particularly around untethering oneself from a physical location while contributing to an aligned tribe.\n\nAs for work, I’ve played different roles such as a medical imaging researcher, soul-sucking fortune 500 company intern, AP/IB science and math teacher at international schools, bizdev co-founder for a Xiaohongshu (Chinese Instagram) based travel agency, co-founder of a memecoin market/social analytics website, growth hacker at a Y Combinator backed startup, creator of a Zoom based web3 introductory course. So far, I’ve found education and building to be my most satisfying work.\n\nA data-hungry scientist, educator, and adventurer is how I best describe myself. I work to apply the scientific method to my life from diet and exercise to learning and relationships.\n\nI’m passionate about education, applications of decentralized blockchain tech, health/longevity, AI, self-determination, community building, self-custody, and freedom.\n\nRecently I’ve been doing some soul searching about how to spend my time and energy. When I read @undefined post about the Network School, my hair stood up. It gave me a wonderful sense of inspiration and in that moment, I **KNEW** it was exactly what I needed to be a part of, in any shape or form. My goals for it are to learn/burn/earn, network, improve my sleep routine, share my skills, and become a founding member of the Network State."

Excited to be here!\n\nI was born and raised in a tiny village in the French countryside.\n\nFrom the age of 10, I immersed myself in books daily.\n\nAt 14, I formed a group of friends around skateboarding. Together, we financed and constructed a skatepark in our village. This early taste of community building and bringing an idea to life fueled my ambitions.\n\nAt 19, I created a YouTube channel called 'People Of'. It quickly gained traction in the music scene, generating millions of views every month. It allowed me to earn my first internet money, empowering me to drop out of law school in Bordeaux and relocate to Paris.\n\nAt 21, I began exploring Augmented Reality, creating AR filters for Instagram and Snapchat. My Instagram filters rapidly made half a billion views. Facebook (now Meta) invited me to their London HQ. There, I connected with fellow creators and the Facebook team behind the Spark AR software, further expanding my horizons.\n\nCurrently, I'm passionate about 3D filmmaking in real-time, a cutting-edge technique using the power of Unreal Engine 5. This technology allows for near-instantaneous 3D rendering (unlike traditional 3D softwares that demands huge rendering time or access to costly render farms).\nI believe we're on the edge of a paradigm shift, where small teams can create cinematic experiences capable of captivating millions while generating significant revenue. This is where I'm now focusing my energy, alongside my interests in AI, cryptocurrency, and philosophy.\n\nGlad to meet y'all❤️ <:newcountry:994308986578935958>"

It would be great if you could both let us know that you want to be roommates, and we can match you up accordingly. \n\nFor roommate matching specifically, it would be helpful if you could email us at admit@ns.com so we have a record of the roommate request.

I grew up soaking in the vibrant culture of Goa, and my adventures have taken me all over—from bustling cities across India to living and working in multicultural Singapore, studying on a beautiful island in Canada, and reconnecting with my roots through yoga & Ayurveda in the foothills of the Himalayas while training staff at a leading wellness resort.\n\nAlong the way, I met my husband, Rajat, and together, we've been on a journey to find inspiring communities, from the varied landscapes of India & Nepal, to the hinterlands of Portugal, cosmopolitan Dubai and tropical Southeast Asia. Rajat introduced me to the world of web3. For us, being part of the Network School is an incredible opportunity for learning, growing, and collaborating, and we are excited to be a part of this revolutionary community.\n\nMy background is all about connecting with people and exploring new ideas:\n- Hospitality & Training: I’ve worked in airlines and hotels, where I learned the art of creating meaningful experiences and embracing diverse cultures. As a Cultural Awareness Trainer with Singapore Airlines, I developed a deep appreciation for cross-cultural communication.\n- Wellbeing & Yoga: I’ve completed a couple of yoga teacher trainings and enjoy blending ancient practices with modern living.\n- Creativity: I’m also exploring my creative side through jewelry design (using Procreate), web3, crypto, and digital art—still new to these, but eager to dive in. I recently completed my masters and wrote my thesis on ‘Establishing And Growing Web3-Enabled Fashion Brands For The Indian Diaspora’.\n\nCan’t wait to connect, grow and collaborate with everyone here. Looking forward to meeting all of you and being part of this amazing journey."

The moment I saw this opportunity on twitter, I just jumped on it. Before this, I wanted to go to Singapore for Breakpoint and Network conference just to see Balaji but this opportunity has taken things to next level where I can learn directly from the GURU himself!. Super pumped up 🙂\n\nMy name is Ramakanth. I am from India but living in Dubai for the last 3 years. Did my Bachelors in IT from India and then my MBA from Canada. Worked in Canada for 9 years but always wanted to get out of a 9 to 5 job and gain my financial freedom. Tried quite a few things such as mobile app development, e-book writing, stock trading, sports betting etc. but nothing worked out. Then I found crypto in Crypto in 2016 and from then on never looked back. Thanks to the bull run in 2021, I could save some money (enough to quit my regular job) and leave Canada. Have been in Dubai since 2021 and waiting for the next bull market to liquidate enough of my portfolio to gain financial freedom and move back to India permanently.\n\nLucky enough to be an early investor in projects such as Graph, Solana, Helium, Livepeer, Stacks etc. Full time crypto investor right now. Loving this independence and cannot think of working a 9 to 5 ever again.\n\nReading, Playing Cricket and Badminton, watching movies have been my hobbies lately. Trying out Bryan Johnson's Blueprint protocol for the last 2 months now. Seeing some good results and it would be interesting to meet Bryan directly and learn from him.\n\nI am super excited to meet you all talented people out there and learn, burn and earn along with you guys. Time to apply for those visas! See you soon 🙂"

I have a background in the jewelry industry in India as a designer/entrepreneur. Last year, I was introduced to Farcaster, and since then, I’ve had the opportunity to design for several web3 communities. I’ve found a deep connection with some, like Nouns Dao, where I’m currently building jewelry collections & developing a Nounish jewelry brand that integrates their various communities.\n\nI’m also working on a transmedia storytelling brand that spans a novel series, films, a jewelry brand, and games. My aspiration is to empower people by gamifying spiritual & martial arts techniques from diverse cultures worldwide, using emerging technologies like AR/VR. I’m pursuing programs in game design, AI filmmaking and film editing, at the side, to be a creator in these emerging mediums.\n\nI’m excited to see meditators here, I have had experiences with a few techniques. I’ve also trained in multiple martial arts like Capoeira, BJJ, Krav Maga, etc. and have been passionate about CrossFit. Would love to explore training & meditating together. \n\nMy life has been a quest for community—a sangha, as Buddha would say—a group of like-minded souls united by a shared purpose & now to be part of this cohort feels surreal. From running 90 day hackathons across writing, fitness, spirituality, startups, with two friends some years back, to actually being part of the most interesting 90 day cohort on the planet, under a teacher and visionary like Balaji, I’m in awe of how life can sometimes answer your deepest dreams. Thanks @undefined for dreaming this dream, for manifesting this dream & for selecting a ‘dark talent’ like me.\n\nI’m sure this is the start of many new journeys, conversations, friendships, communities & network states. Let’s make it happen!"

I started my journey by dropping out of college and searching my path. I love technology and did freelancing for a long time before entering crypto. I ran a service company for a while before building a decentralized Github. \nAs AI is changing everything, I  am working on another challenging idea that builds on top of it.\n\nI love dogs and had a German shepherd for 10 years (passed away last year). He was something that grounded me in India so after that, I moved to wherever opportunities took me. I stay between India, Thailand and Dubai now.\n\nI love that so many people here are into meditation, it’s amazing. Meditation changed my life. I started from the Vipassana retreat in Koh Phangan, thailand where I got my first experience which I couldn’t give words to and got hooked immediately. Post that I spent 8 months meditating in a retreat in India while working remotely. This restructured my understanding of spirituality and awareness.\nI have also dabbed with longevity (food, medicines and fasting)  and seen dramatic changes that the body and mind have when done strictly.\n\nNetwork School is an amazing opportunity and I intend to make the most of it. So anyone here needs some guidance/help in technology, development, crypto, or AI, don’t hesitate to reach out. Meanwhile, I definitely need help with marketing myself and what I build (I feel I am not so great at it) and also working out( I have never been a regular gym goer)\nI understand that we all are here because we are all risk-takers who are not afraid to try something new. I feel that this experience will be transformative for each one of us.

I’m a DeFi power user.\n\nI’m all about using cutting-edge onchain apps & infrastructure, understanding DeFi on a deep level, and educating others.\n\nSince 2021 (just after defi summer), I’ve been very active onchain. The onchain economy was growing, so I left my big4 IT Risk job and joined a venture capital syndicate investing in early stage DeFi projects. \n\nI built relationships with many of our LPs & became their go-to for everything onchain.\n\nWhen the venture syndicate wound down, I doubled down on DeFi and built a company selling research. We covered projects like Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Hyperliquid, Aave, Maker, GMX, Jupiter, Curve, and more. \n\nRecently, I’ve stepped back from that company, and my gf and I have been digital-nomad style traveling in SE Asia. \n\nSkills I’m leveling up at NS (**learn**):\n1. **Onchain data analysis**.  Extracting insights from onchain data. \n2. **Financial analysis**. Building financial models for digital assets. \n3. **Programming**. Building onchain apps, ensuring security, and plugging onchain data into financial models.  \n4. **Systems Design**. Building sustainable, secure, and scalable onchain apps that minimize/eliminate governance risk.\n5. **Content creation**. Providing value beyond my existing client base, promoting NS builders and community members to the broader world, and helping educate others at scale to reduce onchain fraud, theft, and malinvestment. \n\nMy favorite **burn** activities are weightlifting and Muay Thai. \n\nTo anyone here who is not an onchain power users or developer: If you have any questions or want practical blockchain/DeFi knowledge feel free to reach out, tag me, or DM. I love being useful to anyone who wants to use** onchain apps**. There is no question to basic or silly. \n\nI’m 26yrs old. Born in Louisiana, raised in Alabama (rural states in the Southern USA 🇺🇸 ). \n\nHumbled to be here. WAGMI\n\nP.S. I’m in Da Nang, Vietnam until the NS starts. If anyone is here, let me know."

My name is Esther, I’m a 30 year old from the Netherlands. \n\nMy background is in international law, I’ve studied both human rights law and tax law. Currently I’m working for a small international bank from the Netherlands where I am an international tax manager, mainly involved with the investment fund side of our company. However, I’m looking to change my career to something else, although I’m not yet quite sure what exactly. It is also still unclear whether I can continue this job remote, so I might have to quit (please tell me I’m not crazy) which I’ll then see as the trigger to actually start something else.\n\nOn that note, I’ve been learning to program, but I’m still on a very beginner level. I am also interested in anything crypto, AI and web3, I’m definitely not an expert yet but I’ve already learned quite a bit of the basics from my partner (who will join the NS as well!), and looking forward to keep learning about all this at the NS. \n\nOutside of the work sphere I love travelling (just spend 6 months in South America), playing board games, learning new things, and I am a health enthusiast, following Blueprint for a while now. Working out has been a constant throughout my life – from playing field hockey on a decent level, to running several marathons, to doing multiple day hikes. Anything active and I’m in!\n \nAt the Network School I am hoping to meet amazing people, learn a lot, exchange thoughts, get fit and hopefully find a new career path."

I'm in a stage in my life where my sole goal is to level up. To surround myself with the brightest minds and brainstorm then execute huge ideas. I'm in a bit of a lull period where I'm preparing myself for the next crazy venture/business in my life.\n\nI love creating content, and I will create a \"Network State Journey\" series documenting our daily lives, activities and experiences. **Fellow content creators** or those interested to start can absolutely join along on the ride here - just pm me. \n\nAnyone looking to start their next big venture/business, I look forward to meeting and brainstorming. I intend to form an A* Team with those at the NS.\n\nKey interests: \n- I love animals and dogs. Big dog lovers, can meet Butter, my big labrador, on a weekend trip to Singapore. \n-  Reading, Nature, outdoors, fishing, camping, water-sports, outdoor survival, boxing, gym, biohacking, Trading. \n\nRaised in Dubai.

And good to see @undefined, @undefined, @undefined etc from earlier beta lecture group back in 2021! \n\nOn introductions, I’m Jim, Chinese-American currently raising two kids in Manila, Philippines (in this volatile region here, on nearly weekly basis, there could erupt nationalistic and cold-war-like flashpoints for potential escalation into wider Indo-Pacific conflict in terms of worst case scenario. The Philippines is cursed to be in the “Bermuda Triange” between South China Sea Spratlys Islands, Island of Taiwan, and Island of Guam).\n\nI'm here to learn from everyone for the sake of my kids and their generation. I hope my young sons eventually become future TNS Netizens and eventually thrive in new ecosystems that promise a more open, less fragmented, and less antagonistic future — in which one doesn't have to be restricted by nation-state defined systems as “other”, “foreigner”, or “threat to XYZ“ because one holds different passport. \n\nI’m disturbed at how potentially dangerous a junction we are in right now relative to macro history arcs, with the currently sparring Western-order establishment (e.g. G7) versus emerging non-Western (e.g. BRICS) forces. I am appreciative of the network state/network society movement’s potential to explore more peaceful, independent “Linux” paradigms that could, to borrow words of Balaji, engage enterprising Americans, tech progressive Indians, global Chinese, forward looking Europeans and Latin Americans, and aspiring builders from Africa, SE Asia and other Global South areas all together. Places like Singapore would also benefit from more peace and tech globalism amid all the drums of decoupling and war.\n\nMany thanks to @undefined for starting a peaceful global movement (with a school) that is important for future generations on Earth. Looking forward to listening to and learning from everyone."

Stoked to meet you all and connect!\n\nI've been playing with an idea similar to The Network State based on the idea of creating and decentralizing open-source blueprints for factories (ideally employee owned) that would manufacture (as autonomously as possible) products that would themselves automate (as much as possible) the handling of people's needs. The idea being to give people on the ground the tools to come together and build the infrastructure to take care of themselves. \n\nBased on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the foundational level covers Food, Water, & Shelter. Then beyond that level: Health, Education, and Security. So for example the solution set for \"shelter\" could look like a blueprint for a factory that cranks out unfolding shipping container houses. \n\nMy hobbies/interests include music (guitar, piano), travel (spent two years in Asia), amateur ancient history, survival skills, philosophy, spirituality, amateur biology, etc. \n\nI don't know nearly enough about actually using the Blockchain, but I definitely appreciate a number of its potentials and can't wait to learn all about it. Similarly excited to learn about web3, AI, etc. \n\nThe construction industry is a little old school with respect to remote work, so I'll only be able to attend for the first couple of weeks but I'm hoping to form some lasting connections and collaborations!"

I have been working professionally in the industry since 2015. \n\nI got into crypto after being arrested back in 2009 for possession of MDMA. This turned out to be a formative experience. It taught me that the State is a wholly corrupted and debauched, and things need immediate overhaul. \n\nIt was this path that led me down an online rabbit hole. Sometime in 2013 I came into contact with people calling themselves \"cypherpunks.\" Those circles introduced me to bitcoin, and we were off to the races. In this sense, I came into the space as an activist. I wanted --- and still want --- to leverage crypto as a means for personal liberation and societal change. \n\nI have had the opportunity to work directly with people like Roger Ver. I was with bitcoin.com as a news writer, opinion page editor, and communications lead. Then I worked in risk management for an OTC trading desk called Cryptospace. And now I am working in the Network State ecosystem with Logos as a communications professional and writer for a year already. \n\nI have spoken at dozens of cryptocurrency / tech  conferences, have worked with some of the top players in the space, and seen unimaginable things. I also wrote and published a book called \"Dignity & Decency: Rhapsodic Musings of a Modern Anarchist.\" My wife and I have no children and are quasi-digitally nomadic. \n\nI am here because I believe the network state is the path to realizing the vision of a more liberated humanity. I cannot wait to meet you all, continue our shared education, and help enlighten the denizens of this planet for the sake of our future. \n\nOur posterity counts on it."

I also am a community organizer. Right now, I’m committed to exploring all of my curiosities. Life is too short. \n\nI’m not super well versed in crypto but am particularly curious about web3/community daos. I’m extremely bullish on AI and am excited for all the good that is yet to come— devices for the blind and deaf, cancer treatment, and so much more. Before this summer, I’ve never built a line of code in my life. Using Claude, I’ve been able to build 5 websites and chatbots and tools and just having lots of fun! I am a creator and need to constantly be tinkering on little creative side projects like community building, writing, art, social media content etc. \n\nAt NS, I hope to meet other creators and friendly people, have focus time to strategically plan and work on my businesses, get fit, explore Singapore and nearby areas on weekends perhaps and just learn new things! \n\nLooking forward to meeting everyone!!"

Since then, I've been deep in crypto, currently working at Flashbots, where we solve MEV problems and build Ethereum infrastructure like MEV-Boost. We're also exploring hardware-based solutions like TEE for credible and confidential computing (same tech used for Apple Intelligence).

I'm at a \"mid-life crisis\" point as a crypto builder, seeing how much of the space has drifted from the original crypto spirit. Some key concerns I have include:\n\n1. Centralization Creep: Growing influence of institutional players (e.g., ETFs) potentially centralizing power and increasing vulnerability to attacks.\n2. Speculative Casino Culture: Influx of opportunists and scammers across all levels, turning the industry into a speculative playground—where the yield/return comes from.\n3. Self-Regulation Failure: Industry's struggle to self-regulate and prevent bad actors from hijacking the movement, exposing limitations of libertarian ideals.\n4. Hype Over Substance: Prevalence of shallow, overhyped projects optimized for impressing retails and quick exits rather than creating real impact or sustainable business/protocol, fostering a culture of pseudo-profound but ultimately meaningless innovations.\n\nBalaji's clear big-picture thinking was what I loved most about 1729. (I often joke he's our era's Hari Seldon, while I'm still the clueless encyclopedist – Foundation fans will get it.)\n\nI'm here to:\n\n1. Find my own answers to the big questions about crypto as an industry and movement\n2. Get a clearer picture of our current world\n3. Gain more clarity and conviction for my future path\n\nExcited to embark on this journey with you all – can't wait to learn from you, have fun, and tackle these challenges together!"

I previously worked in the food industry and video production here in Japan. In 2019, I joined Kraken Japan, but last year, I decided to branch out on my own. I started a newsletter called 'Bee Curious' where I share fascinating insights about Japan https://paragraph.xyz/@beecurious. This May, I also launched 'Farcastea,' the first tea on-chain, at the Farcon event link: https://farcastea.xyz/. I'm thrilled to be here and can't wait to meet you all in person!"

After a stint in government consulting, I jumped into crypto full-time in 2021. I’ve been freelancing with a web3 game studio and staying active in web3 gaming communities like Wolves DAO. When I’m not working, you’ll usually find me playing cricket, badminton, table tennis, or chess. Excited to join this cohort, mix learning with fitness, and meet others who are also into exploring new ideas. Looking forward to connecting and growing with everyone!"

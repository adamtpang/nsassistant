A social network? A directory? A super app?\nALEKSANDAR SVETSKI\nDEC 20 2024\n¬†\nHow & where it all started:\nIn 2023, I was working on The Spirit of Satoshi - a Bitcoin centric LLM that we built our own dataset for and then trained, along with basic RLHF tools (with lightning payouts). We must have trained at least 30 models, maybe more.\n¬†\nBy the end of the year, I concluded that even though we started to generate some revenue, there wasn‚Äôt really a serious business there. At least not a startup worth investing capital into and scaling.\n¬†\nAround the same time, a seed of another idea had been planted in my mind via two small events.\n1. A friend reached out on Telegram asking if we could train some sort of AI on all the bitcoin-friendly locations around the world to act as a bitcoin-travel-assistant.\n2. My wife and I were in Salvador trying to find a good coffee place, and all the high-rated places on Google sucked. We only found a place thanks to a word of mouth referral.\n¬†\nRobert, (the same friend who reached out to me on Telegram) and I bumped into each other in Salvador, and we realised that the AI assistant was the wrong UX. We figured that people need something more visual. Something more like‚Ä¶.NomadList. This led us to the originally idea which we not-so-creatively called: ‚ÄúBitcoin NomadList.‚Äù\n¬†\nWe adapted the idea over a few iterations into a sort of social network for bitcoiners and nomads called ‚ÄúSatlantis.‚Äù\n¬†\n‚Ä¶ S stands for Sovereign. So Satlantis = Sovereign Atlantis, or the ‚Äúpromised land‚Äù for Sovereign Individuals.\n¬†\nSatlantis aims to be a super app for nomads, bitcoiners, remote workers, and sovereign individuals, combining features of NomadList, Meetup, Instagram and TripAdvisor\n¬†\nTBC in thread"

The good thing is that it has everything integrated: wlan router. It takes like 40-50 watts so you can use a strong USB-C charging plug for it or even a powerbank. There is, I think, no official support for the USB-C to the powerplug it needs.

This means for every sBTC created, there‚Äôs an equal amount of Bitcoin securely locked to back it. When you mint sBTC, you send BTC into a secure system. The BTC is unlocked and returned to you when you redeem.\n\nsBTC is secured by the largest pool of signers/validators in an open membership network. And anyone can join this pool of signers.\n\nNote that they are capping initial deposits at 1,000 BTC because they want to make sure everything is working properly, which means there could be risks/a few kinks to iron out. \n\nCongrats again to the ecosystem!\n\nhttps://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-gets-defi-upgrade-stacks-launches-bitcoin-backed-sbtc-for-smart-contracts"

You can mess with each of the variables on MSTR-tracker.com but keeping in mind the nav premium spiked to nearly 4 around the ATH we really don't need anything crazy to happen to break new all time highs.  For Matt's $500 calls $100k btc and 2.7 Nav gets him there, $100k and 2.8 NAV gets $525.  more realistically with $110k BTC $500 can be hit with a <2.5 NAV, If BTC moons past that it's game over Saylor can ATM it all and we still moon."

The first scenario is more short term bullish the second stacks way more BTC at a much lower price without lowering the MSTR price below $400 as he is doing it into the increased selling.

Tesla mooning too, I had a small limit sell order hit at $467 last night, I should probably have withdrawn it to pay for this weekend in Singapore but no it's right in MSTR."

There's also a chance BTC just goes up a bunch like Tom Lee thinks and creates the MSTR spike that goes with that which would compound the QQQ catalyst, we could get lucky and Amazon or a nation state announce they are buying BTC  or some other catalyst that pours fuel on the fire.\n\nI'm excited but also grounded 99% of trad-fi is still totally sleeping on MSTR and it's ambitious to think this will be the catalyst to change that when they have ignored the previous 100 wake up calls.

The higher the market cap, the higher your allocation. It is estimated that if included MSTR will have an allocation of 0.46% \n\nAlthough the Nasdaq 100 itself rebalances annually on the 3rd Friday of every December, the weighting‚Äôs are adjusted quarterly (March,June,September,December) to reflect any market cap changes. So if MSTR‚Äôs market cap continues to rise, then in March they will be given a bigger weighting in the index, also if it falls, it will be given a lower weighting. The ETFs and fund tracking the index will also then have to rebalance to keep their weightings accurate to the index. \n\nWith their initial 0.46% weighting, this is estimated to bring an inflow of around $2.1bn into MSTR. This figure is NOT a weekly, monthly or annual figure, it is the initial inflow of cash from share buys if they are added to the index. Although the Nasdaq itself doesn‚Äôt directly buy shares becuse it‚Äôs just a index, funds and ETFs like QQQ, QQQM, QLD who track the performance of the index all buy shares equal to that of the index weightings. \n\nIf included MSTR can still sell shares ATM between the confirmation and the actual rebalancing. There are no rules against this. \n\nMSTR is classed as a tech company by multiple classification companies which Nasdaq use to determine sectors. MSTR is currently classed as a tech company by all these companies and so Nasdaq have to class it as a tech company. \n\nThey have met all criteria to be added, however no one knows for sure until market close tomorrow."

Society was changing and there was also a growing interest in science and technology. \n\nIn the spirit of enlightenment these grand structures called School of Arts were built in our towns, for public lectures and diffusion of the latest knowledge and skills to a rising middle class. Out of these humble voluntary operations developed the local public library, the modern neighbourhood centre, and formal systems of adult and technical education.\n\nUnderpinning the movement were the ideas that industry and society would benefit from a scientifically educated artisan class and that a new breed of inventors would arise from this class.\n\nhttps://www.digitalplayhouse.org.au/post/a-new-school-of-arts-movement-for-industry-4-0-to-5-0"

Collect fees from both and when it gets within 25% of either bound just move the bounds on both? Then I'd only be exposed to half my bag in binary(or sol lol) going down rapidly.  Surely this is a thing? I guess you would have to set up a new liquidity pool with the assets rotated sol to binary.\n\nDo people do this and what's the risks I haven't thought of?"

Go to new places and try to uncover as much of the map as possible. There are rankings and stuff. Quite addictive\n-Send stickers to your friends\n-notifies you if your friends just entered a new country\n\nDrawback:\n-you share your location data with your friends and the french company that runs the servers. But you can turn it off selectively (if you go to a strip club or some such place)\n\nWhat I like most is that the app removes the \"overhead/chore\" of asking your friends where they are and meeting up. Sometimes, my friends just come to me spontaneously or I come to them. Privacy is important but I trade it away for something that gives me value.\n\nDownload the app here and let's be friends:\n\nhttps://invite.amo.co/bump/jNe9C7bsLSSA\n\nMy number: +4915778275879"

    "content": "Interesting parallels indeed Luke.üëç  The centralization of power by nation states (esp superpower ones) mask the statistics of how much variance, complexity, and size there are within the label of nation states, while nation state politicians arguably have the tendency to label all things in one bucket.  335 million in United States: including largest population of Assyrians in the world, ~ 5 million Indian-Americans, ~ 5 million Chinese-Americans, ~ 3 million Russian-Americans, ~half million Iranian-Americans, ~11 million undocumented migrants, etc. 1.4 billion in China: Half of USA is essentially the size of Sichuan Province plus City of Chongqing, Russia is essentially size of Guangdong Province. India is even arguably more diverse and larger. Yes, Balaji has said many good insights as well on related topics. There had been analogies of the parallel societies movement as an open-source \"Linux\" to the existing sparring \"Windows\" and \"OSX\".  Given how fast things are moving, and what 20th century history has taught us, probably no one wants to end up being a part of a \"1930's like\" statistic. \n\n**If this discussion gets too long, maybe we open a thread? Discussing these posts have been somewhat therapeutic as one sometimes feels like being on knife's edge, in this Asia-Pacific region, frustrated by these seemingly irreversible and irreconcilable nation state driven conflicts that have ripple effects over everything, even our very lives."

One reason Systems Theory and Game Theory rose to prominence in the Cold War (on both sides) is that they offered a pathway for making sense- ‚Äògetting a handle on‚Äô- circumstances and events that are super difficult to grasp without a methodology of abstraction.   Otherwise, As Nation-States premised on highly centralized organizational structure, the flood of data & information, etc becomes all noise.  \n\nRespecting that people in NS have many ties to many countries and places‚Äî and presumably would prefer World Powers find a way to get along‚Äî we might benefit from considering the Non-aligned Movement from the Cold War (iirc Balaji discusses this in the book).\nThe NAM contributed to the establishment of new governments and states (recognizing sovereignty), creating a pathway for legitimacy that didn‚Äôt depend on an USSR/USA dichotomy.  De-centralization of the centers of power contributed to reduction in tensions, dialog between the super powers, and global moral legitimacy increasing in importance‚Ä¶. Especially as television spread around the world.\nLots of parallels to be found."

This is arguably good for US domestically (~4% of world population), but could be somewhat unsettling from international perspective.\n\n1 - Arguably not good for digital nomads in terms of fragmented world. (What if COVID travel restrictions are precursor of what may yet to come?)\n\n2 - Arguably not good for Asia-Pacific in terms of stability. Escalated conflict centered on region with ~60% of world population, > 60% of trade, possibly > 60% of armaments and deployable military power could be frightening. Escalated hot US-China war could trigger blockade and counter-move in Strait of Malacca. Arguably not good for Forest City and Singapore. Problem of dumping China with N. Korea/Iran/Venezuela etc is that China (like India) is a subcontinent with population equal to that of US + EU + SE Asia combined and biggest tradiing partner in most emerging economies ‚Äî the ripple effects would be vast.\n\nIf you are raising a family, you arguably don‚Äôt want to be raising it in the 1930‚Äôs (the analogy that Dalio gives).\n\nOpen question - how could network societies cushion the blow for potentially thousands and millions in a hypothetical 1930‚Äôs scenario? Beyond tech and crypto libertarianism, could this trigger further scaling opportunities for the parallel society movement?\n\n- Potentially millions of migrants and refugees who don‚Äôt want to return to their damaged home countries but are shunned/deported/blocked by developed countries that are now anti-immigration/trending right. (What percentage of illegals/migrants are criminals vs. honest families just trying to build better lives for themselves and their families?)\n\n- Potentially hundreds of thousands of people with families who are spread between Western and non-Western countries. The Americans living in Beijing or Shanghai or Shenzhen, the Chinese-Americans in Texas, the Iranian-Americans in Florida, the Taiwanese who just want to get on with their lives without planes buzzing on top, the Filipinos who worry about South China Sea escalations, the Singaporeans who have investments in both US and China, etc?"

The verdict in Poland was ‚Äúcontract invalidation‚Äù, as if the mortgage transaction had never happened. In result borrowers are being refunded with all the payments they made to banks and banks should get the initial value of loan principal. Very often the net result leaves the borrower with property and decent amount of cash from the bank.\" Learn more here: https://thebankingscene.com/opinions/polish-fx-mortgage-loans-and-the-ethos-in-banking and here: https://www.dw.com/en/whats-at-stake-in-polands-swiss-franc-case/a-65920810"

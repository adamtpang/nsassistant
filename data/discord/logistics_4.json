Will be applying for 1 month SG visa this week, it appears we have Visa free entry into Malaysia for 30 days (with a DAC, also requires return ticket + hotel confirmation).\n\nPer my understanding, we may need to fly back every 30 days, or reapply SG visa each month to go across the border and return to Malaysia to reset the 30 day clock?\n\nWonder if we can get an official NS admit letter with our details and program duration, and can get an extended duration approved from the Malaysia High Commission."

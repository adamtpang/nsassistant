Maximizing Value Exchange with the External Environment: The organization must focus on creating more value in its outputs (exports) than it consumes from external resources (imports). This ensures that the organization is a net contributor and remains competitive and profitable.\n    2.    Fair and Strategic Resource Allocation: Resources should be allocated proportionally to the value each component or individual contributes, ensuring that those who drive the most impact are rewarded accordingly."

(Highly recommend the book!) \n\nI utilize a mental model \"FourGame Dynamics\" in parts of the summary/notes. 4G helps you remain aware of the subjective-personal, technical-material, social-historical, and spiritual-metaphysical dimensions/aspects of  anything (from your own life to any external phenomenon). You can read more about 4G in the book summary or ignore it totally! The summary works with or without that element. I've found it handy in helping quickly sensemake and communicate with others when there are new or complex areas of interest or situations involving many worldviews/disciplines.  FourGames is a personal research project of mine (and hopefully will one day be a Network State and community all on it's own, we're starting with a private retreat center in Shasta, CA and some online content). \n\nFeel free to DM me if FourGames is of interest or if you have trouble accessing the book summary. Mods, if this is in the wrong area ofc feel free to move or delete it (and sorry in advance!).\n\nhttps://x.com/johntgiuffre/status/1845223737735442481"

    "content": "Hey guys, had a chat with several people. Few things to announce:\n\n1) **Feature requests**. First, many of the recent feature requests were already in our backlog of issues to address. Some of them we are addressing in a different way (eg rather than Discord search we are rolling out a community Notion). And still others we like but may not be able to address in the short term till we secure more space (like ice baths). But in general your best bet is to fill out https://ns.com/feedback. If there are _many_ requests for something then we will likely do it if economically feasible. But if it‚Äôs just one person asking it, then we have to triage. The goal is the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\n2) **Thursday at 6:30pm**. Second, we have an official recurring community forum now on Thursdays at 6:30pm (https://lu.ma/zta02wc0) in the club on the 13th floor. This is a supplement to https://ns.com/feedback.\n\n3) **Monday at 1pm**. Third, by request, on Monday at 1pm we will also be clarifying certain mutual expectations we have of each other. We‚Äôll explain the dos and do nots of the community with Goofus and Gallant examples (see: https://bit.ly/3Y0WLeF). For example, Gallant picks up after himself while Goofus litters. Gallant praises publicly and criticizes privately, while Goofus does the opposite. Gallant is a respectful guest, while Goofus doesn‚Äôt respect local Malaysian customs. Basically, you should be an NS member, not simply an NS customer. \n\n4) **Balance as a value**. Finally, I also just had a good discussion with @undefined on what our values are. In general, we are _not_ a purely Western libertarian society. We have significant East Asian and South Asian influence, so stability, harmony, and loyalty are values. The reason for this is that Western society is simply no longer the right model for itself, let alone the world. Indeed, the complete failure of Western governance is why many of you are here.\n\nThe TLDR is that Western societies do not have balance. There is a needed balance between values like privacy and transparency, between values like community moderation and censorship resistance, and the West simply doesn‚Äôt understand the idea of balance anymore.\n\nOverall, if you like Singaporean Society more than either Chinese Control or American Anarchy, then you‚Äôll like NS. And if not, or if you want a different balance, then we will help you find, found, and/or fund another community. Indeed, that‚Äôs part of what we are here for ‚Äî to be a startup community that boots up other startup communities. To create a society Lee Kuan Yew would be proud of. And to fund many more Lee Kuan Yews.\n\nMore on Monday!"

You're welcome to contribute to that if you like, or make your own initiatives and collaborate with the many devs we have here to make things you want to exist. \n\nI think at this time the dev team that is building for the Network School in an official capacity solely consists of Jacob who is doing an excellent job of managing the ns.com site and perhaps handling some of the NFT stuff. This may be because the priority is to ensure we have a functioning infrastructure related to the core Network School concept. I haven't seen the team reach out for help with development from the community, but perhaps in the future when priorities shift from immediate concerns to long term planning, they will put out a vision and timeline for the software stack for the Network State."

However, here at Network School, I find myself planning my buffet indulgences from the night before. I pre-negotiate with myself whether noodles are too much, considering that one of my goals in coming here was to get fitter. If you ask anyone who has lived or traveled with me, they'll tell you I hate breakfast; I go most days without it. \"It's for girls only,\" I tell my girlfriend. So it's quite odd that I'm now dreaming about breakfast.\n\nThis romanticization of breakfast is new to me, but I am embracing it fully. It's a reward after a hard workout and, given my time zone difference, an opportunity to catch up with loved ones back home. With my headphones on and FaceTime in hand, I race to the buffet after a burn workout. First stop: the fruit station. I find a table and place my plate before heading back to the buffet circle with another plate, on the hunt for something good.\n\nI peek at the \"should be lunch\" but served at breakfast section and move on. The typical breakfast buffet routine involves multiple rounds of filling a small plate, placing it on your table, and going back for other items. French toast, eggs, samosas, potatoes, beans, and you can't forget the pink guava. No veggies at breakfast because I'll have more this week in Blueprint food than I have had in the last year of my life.\n\nAs I return to my table‚Äînow crowded with 3-5 plates‚Äîthe thought of \"healthy eating\" crosses my mind again. But then I remind myself that I'm actually doing better than usual. With a small smile, I pick up my fork and dig in, savoring each bite of my newfound fondness for a morning feast."

A Spartan hack is to try to hold in a mouthful of water throughout your workout. You'll improve very quickly doing this. Can get messy though."

We only allow members to host events on the 2nd floor of Coworking** if your event has 50 members or more registered.** This is a lesson we learned last year - members trying to do their work found it very distracting if small groups were using the mics/screens.\n\nIf your event crosses the 50-person threshold, I will teach you how to use the screen. \n\nUntil then, I recommend using the ping pong room or one of the other rooms on 13 for an indoor event.

These massive reptiles, capable of growing over 6 meters (20 feet) long, are found in Singapore‚Äôs coastal waters, mangroves, and estuaries. Places like Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Kranji Reservoir, and the coastal areas around Pulau Ubin are known spots where they‚Äôve been sighted.\n\nThey‚Äôre not super common, though‚ÄîSingapore‚Äôs urban environment limits their presence, and there are likely only a small number around, possibly stragglers from larger populations in nearby Malaysia or Indonesia. Encounters are infrequent enough to grab headlines when they happen. So, while they‚Äôre definitely there, you‚Äôre not likely to see one unless you‚Äôre in the right wild or semi-wild areas at the right time!"

Here in the Philippines, we have the SRRV program (Special Retiree Resident Visa) and SIRV program (Special Investor Resident Visa), which are similar but less expensive (no property requirement, although money remitted into the program could be used for future condo purchases). The SRRV and SIRV programs allow participants to be eligible to work for a local company (although a separate work permit application is required, the work permit will not need to be tied to a work-visa, which is usually harder to get). The Malaysian MMH2 program also allows one to work for a local company with additional work permit, with added benefit that those over 50 do not need to get work permit."

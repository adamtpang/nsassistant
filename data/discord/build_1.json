I.e. standard meal plus plant protein or plus meat ? \n- A rice cooker with brown rice & quinoa for everyone to fill their plates from, to satisfy calorie needs \n\nDa and I talked about a survey.

Please write your name down when you check out any stuff from there and make sure to return it.\n\n**Table tennis**: 13th floor, turn right after the elevators, walk to the room all the way at the end.\n**Volleyball**: there's a net on the beach, if you go down to the pool just keep walking straight to the beach, it's a bit to the right when you exit but you'll see it.\n**Basketball**: two fields here https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYzjDAPcA6wU92kt5, one here https://maps.app.goo.gl/eCQBvpExyAWgG7kw7. Both on the way to the NS Co-working space.\n**Football**:  could of course play beach football on the beach, https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z3jCjHpLFincFj2z8  (on the way to NS Co-working) is a basketball court with a cage surrounding it so the football doesn't fly off into any windows so is the best non-sandy option. We haven't found an actual football field anywhere, is someone finds it will gladly edit.\n**Pickleball**: the basketball court here https://maps.app.goo.gl/oNSCdb5QQ2JL27X99, just after the very first bridge when you exit the hotel to the co-working space seems like the best place. The basketball field opposite to it is also a possibility, the football location could also work."

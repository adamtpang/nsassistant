Here‚Äôs how it works:\n\n1) _Read books at ns.com/learn._ There‚Äôs a weekly list of books at ns.com/learn, all on various aspects of building startup societies, with links to get them on Amazon.\n\n2) _Discuss books on Tuesday afternoon._ Each week, we‚Äôll hold a book club in the NS Cafe right before dinner time on Tuesday from 4-6pm. The first hour prior to dinner will be silent reading, and the second hour will be live discussion, which you can continue during dinner at 6pm. We‚Äôll group you for book club as we did for the mixer.\n\n3) _Optionally, quiz and Warpcast review._ Each book has an optional quiz to self-test your understanding and get an NFT for your ns.com/profile. For extra credit, write a book review (whether full post or tweet length) and post it from your warpcast.com account.\n\n**The First Three NS Books**\nMost books on our list relate to startup societies, but the first week's curriculum is focused on self-improvement:\n\na) _Atomic Habits_ is James Clear‚Äôs guide to programming yourself\nb) _Navalmanack_ is my friend Naval‚Äôs guide to building wealth\nc) And _Tools of Titans_ is Tim Ferriss‚Äôs collection of successful heuristics from the successful\n\nWhy assign these three first? We're front-loading these three in particular so you can keep going back to them in the weeks/months that follow to keep getting value out of them. These types of books generate compound interest. Think of this as the \"win\" part of \"win-and-help-win\", the individual self-improvement part that's a daily part of the Network School Curriculum.\n\n**Next Steps**\nOK. As next steps, all you have to do is:\n\na) get the books on Kindle via [ns.com/learn](https://ns.com/learn) and \nb) sign up for the first book club from 4-6pm on Tuesday via [lu.ma/61pn7tfw](https://lu.ma/61pn7tfw)\n\nWe'll assign groups like for the mixer prior to Tuesday at 4pm. See you then!"

You must also ensure that you meet the [entry requirements](https://www.passportindex.org/country/singapore/) and have a Singapore visa if necessary based on your passport.\n\n4) üá≤üáæ **Malaysia Arrival Card**. All members must complete the [Malaysia Digital Arrival Card](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main) within 3 days of your planned entry into Malaysia.

    "content": "**TRAINERS BACK ON SUNDAY! Gym is now open 7 days per week.**\nOk folks, the trainers are back on Sunday (9/29) and will be back every day going forward. Just like the internet or the roads, our gyms are open seven days per week. Because many people really do want that daily workout, including me.\n\nBut wait. What about rest days? What about people who are sore?!? Well, the key concept here is _maximum sustainable intensity_. Here are your options each morning:\n\n1) Feeling good? Go to gym3 for a high intensity workout.\n2) Feeling a bit sore? Go to gym1 for a low intensity workout.\n3) Feeling sick, or very sore, or injured? Take a rest day for yourself.\n\nThat is: health is incredibly personalized. It's not true that everyone needs the same amount of rest days. It's just like work: some people can only work 40 hours per week and others can do 80. Similarly, some people are out of shape and can only tolerate 3 workouts/week at first, while others want 7 days/week. So, if you really need a rest day, of course you should take it, but that doesn't mean the gyms shut down. It's just like the internet ‚Äî if you need to log off, you can, but that doesn't mean the internet shuts down.\n\n*Gym1: low intensity workouts*\nI mentioned low intensity workouts in gym1. How does that work? Well, we will soon turn gym1 into a lower intensity workout studio for yoga, stretching, and mobility with classes from Cloudfit. And of course you can also do a gym3 workout with lower weights, or lower speed, thereby dialing back the level of intensity as you see fit.\n\nBut of course it's easy to dial intensity down to zero. That's the default in the outside world. What's more interesting is an environment where you can maintain _maximum sustainable intensity_. That's what we're building here. And so the gyms will be open 7 days a week, and the trainers will be present, so that those who prefer an intense daily morning workout will be able to get it. üí™ üëü\n\nPS: Go book your slot at https://cal.com/networkschool if you haven't. See you tomorrow üôÇ"

Here in the Philippines, there are many who support expanded US military base access due to South China Sea tensions and then there are also those who worry that expanded US military base access would make the ASEAN country -- close to Taiwan island -- an unfortunate proxy / pawn in any conflict. Many in ASEAN arguably are worried about being collateral damage or unintentional proxy to superpower nation state conflict. If the most recent pew surveys are reliable, ASEAN opinion is arguably pretty even, about slightly over 50% favoring PRC versus around 49% favoring US. I am guessing many in Malaysia, Singapore etc are actually fairly pro-PRC compared to the mainstream opinion in North America (in some ways due to infrastructure Belt and Road investments etc), grab a periodical like Lian He Zao Bao in Singapore to take a look.\n\nIn any case, I only brought up this topic due to the earlier mention of November 5 election. It is a super relevant election (and people follow it nervously) -- many in the ASEAN region feeling like being on the knife's edge are hoping for at least sensible leadership on all sides so that tensions are managed responsibly and escalations do not occur."

This broader region hosts arguably over ~60% of world's trade passage, nearly over ~60% of the world's population, and possibly over ~60% of the world's military firepower arsenal. Hopefully whoever comes out on top on November 5th has the sensilbility to not rock an already unsteady boat.  To peace (or at least detente or some kind of mutual understanding to not escalate).\n\nThat the US Indo-Pac Command and the PRC Southern Theater Command just spoke recently...is a welcome sign for stability.\n\nOn side note: this feeling of being in an intensely divided era and living on the knife's edge of intense nation state rivalry makes the peaceful alternative global network initiatives Balaji is leading even more relevant -- for us, for our families and communities, and also for future generations."

If one of us was looking for a project to work on, we could scan the project table.\n\nNow though, I wonder if you could let people combine free-form writing and box-ticking to input whatever they think is relevant for their bio and/or project descriptions.

    "content": "I am not sure if ChatGPT is just bullshiting but might worth a try:\n\nThe constant spinning in a D3 force simulation is typically caused by an imbalance in the forces applied to the nodes in the graph. In your case, the radial force may be causing this behavior, as it constantly pulls the nodes toward a specific point. Here are some suggestions to avoid the spinning:\n\n1. **Reduce the strength of the radial force:**\n   The radial force might be too strong, so you can try reducing its impact or even removing it temporarily to see if it stops the spinning.\n\n   ```js\n   .force('radial', d3.forceRadial(50, SIMULATION_WIDTH / 2, SIMULATION_HEIGHT / 2).strength(0.05));\n   ```\n\n   You can experiment with different `strength` values to find the right balance.\n\n2. **Add a force to dampen the motion (force simulation velocity decay):**\n   D3 simulations have a `velocityDecay` parameter that can help slow down the motion over time, reducing or stopping spinning.\n\n   ```js\n   this.simulation = d3.forceSimulation()\n       .velocityDecay(0.9)  // Adjust this number (0.9 is a typical value for damping)\n       .force('link', d3.forceLink().id((d: any) => (d.id)).distance(100))\n       .force('charge', d3.forceManyBody().strength(-300))\n       .force('center', d3.forceCenter(SIMULATION_WIDTH / 2, SIMULATION_HEIGHT / 2))\n       .force('radial', d3.forceRadial(50, SIMULATION_WIDTH / 2, SIMULATION_HEIGHT / 2));\n   ```\n\n   A higher `velocityDecay` value (closer to 1) slows down the motion more quickly.\n\n3. **Ensure there are no excessive charges or imbalances:**\n   Sometimes, an overly strong charge force can create erratic motion. You might want to experiment with the charge strength to find the right balance between stability and attraction.\n\n   ```js\n   .force('charge', d3.forceManyBody().strength(-100));\n   ```\n\n   Reducing the charge strength should help stabilize the layout.\n\nTry these adjustments, and they should help to stop or reduce the spinning behavior of your graph."

Here is how we achieved it:\n\nFirst, we tried with hubble endpoints[1], but the issue was clear each user was causing us 4 api calls[2], to get to the followers from usernames, also the time machine functionality was not possible due to the latest data hubble api provides.\nThen we ran our own hub snapshot and used it to backfill a postgres database(still backfilling 400k/800k Farcaster id‚Äôs) [3]\nThe data is still backfilling so currently some of the users would fetch empty results.\nThe frontend is written in react and we are using d3 for visualization as a graph. backend is written in node which for now just queries the postgres db\n\nWe can optimize the queries further to reduce the query time for large queries, also let us know if we could add any other functionality to it. Also now since we have all the data in postgres feeding from hubble, we can do a lot of things with this\n@undefined and I worked on this so anyone who wants to know more or contribute, let us know\n\n[1] https://docs.farcaster.xyz/hubble/hubble#hosted-instances\n[2] https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/hubble/httpapi/links\n[3] https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo/tree/main/packages/shuttle\n\n\nUpdate:\nAdded new columns for data, queries are insanely fast now\nupdated usernames available in thread\nfixed a few bugs"

I'm not proposing a practical suggestion that would ultimately create work for the admin team.\n\nüí°  There's a clause that references the NS's ability to update the agreement. It would be cool if updates had a git-like history. Specifically, it would be helpful to see a \"git diff\" when the contract changes. That is, it would be helpful to view the specific portions of the agreement that have changed and how.\n\nI'm not sure it would provide much value for this specific agreement. However, I share it as an idea because the opaqueness of the legal system and the tendency for laws+contracts to grow (and never shrink), is often cited as a root cause for societal decay. Since we're interested in considering new ways to \"do society\", I wanted to put the provocation out there.\n\nAs NS and other aspiring Network States create contracts and agreements with their citizens, what is the opportunity to avoid the trappings of legal & contractual bloat from the earliest days?"

Please jump in if you like.\n\n**DIPLOMACY PROTOCOL** \nFor standardised quick communication between communities based on **acknowledgement**.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n**STEP 1. Acknowledgement**\n\nEach community keeps a list of other communities it ***acknowledges***.\n\nA world map currently is essentially from the perspective of a citizen of a country. e.g. Europeans put Europe in the centre.\n\nSo each community will have their own world map, on which flags from other acknowledged communities could be displayed.\n\nA basic protocol of acknowledgement could include\n**- 1 url at which census data can be fetched**\n\n(Probably no need for blockchain, because in the end it's all on the basis of trust and acknowledgement.)\n\nExample summary data:\n\n```\nNetwork School Forest City\n153\nns.com\n```\n1st line, the full name\n2nd line the registered population count\n3rd line a website\n\nCould extend this with real estate footprint (m¬≤), or turn it into a key value map, with a few required properties and then more and more optional but standardised properties.\n\n**Step 2. Agreements**\n\nAfter acknowledgement, there are many agreements you can imagine. \n\ne.g. It's easy to imagine a trade agreement if the communities are professional guilds. \n\n**Step 3. Information Technology**\n\nUsing a standardised protocol, you can now implement that protocol as an API (rpc).\n\n***This can formalise and streamline processes; 100x it in speed compared to the current bureaucracies.***\n\ne.g. A formal request for a meeting between representatives.\n\ne.g. A formal request for AID.\n\nEvery agreement, would have a standard list of functions to call.\n\n---\n\n**If we begin with the end in mind, we can build in a straight line towards it. **\n\n(If we do not, how long would it take to get there?)\n\n`Request for Comments`"

You only need to attend one of these events; there are two of them to acommodate people in different time zones. \n\n1) The first is for the Asia/Europe Time Zone in about 16 hours: \nhttps://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEod-6prjstHNbihNdEEejWix6F0G5OyFjP \n\n2) The second is for the Americas Time Zone in about 31 hours: \nhttps://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUrdu-trDotG9CzTJtN0OXWFNqpY9Ofymya \n\n3) Here is also a Docsend that explains what we're doing (you should have received this by email as well):\nhttps://docsend.com/view/iikpzun3cqushndw\n\nTLDR: the Network School is about frontier, not fancy. We focused on making it affordable for the dark talent, and getting a place where we could scale the community and edit the physical buildings. While I personally think the island weather is quite pleasant, and I'm spending a lot of time there, it's not meant to be a luxury resort. Instead, the Network School is a place to build yourself up, not a place to spend lots of money. If that works for you, we're excited to have you there! If not, we will happily refund anyone as we have thousands of people on the waitlist, so just DM @undefined. You can also wait for Network School v2 or v3, that's totally fine.\n\n4) OK! I'll speak more about this on the Zooms and answer any questions. Again, looking forward to seeing you!"

TNS Parallel: In this parallel society movement we have the strength of Balaji, Bryan Johnson, maybe Vitalik, etc.\n- Use cases that go beyond technical papers to a burgeoning economy. TNS Parallel: Network society economy parallel to crypto economy.\n- Movement value proposition going mainstream --  BTC from an initial techie fringe BBS-board thing (pre-2013) to becoming a grass-roots one that even a cabbie in Cambodia can understand, recognize, and own. TNS Parallel: a thousand netizens -> to a million+ netizens.\n- Distributed political power, especially in young voters, as crypto vote has become a critical constitutiency in almost every voting district (at least in the US), with enough passionate voters to swing the election direction. TNS Parallel: If there is a sigificant number of voters, especially young voters (longer vote lifetime), legally present in almost every significant jurisdiction and constituency, who believe in network societies or are netizens too, then establishment politicians will think twice about accusing, banning, or calling \"threats to democracy.\""

I bring up this topic around legal and tax protection because it is likely to be something that will come up when times get tough -- as Balaji says, when the establishments fight back. There is a parallel to accusations on Bitcoin/crypto -- in that the establishment nation state institutions may hurl similar witch-hunt accusations around illegal this and illegal that. The network state/network society movement needs to be ready to defend itself -- parallel to how the crypto industry eventually found ways to defend itself, sometimes with legions of lawyers and lobbyists.\n\nI brought up global membership fees as one example, but yes, it doesn't need to be that. How DAOs are treated in terms of legal compliance would go a long way in terms of defending network state infrastructure legality. Is anyone here an expert on DAO legal and compliance matters?"

Geographical constraints or political boundaries do not limit their formation. One critical understanding of network states is that they do not have to be coercive or mandatory, unlike nation-states. They can and should be voluntary. The historical root of the network state was philosophical and political, with no technological ingredient. That original idea is called ‚Äúpanarchy.‚Äù"

This could help establish the intellectual and cultural foundation of the community while also ensure that our ideas are taken seriously and studied by future generations.\nWhile network states can be created faster than physical territories, the culture we build must be robust and substantial üôå"

Professional accountant here, working on a model for decentralised global professional association (will be open source and adaptable to other professions).

However, we'd disintermediate the role and functions  of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) which is registered in NY, USA. \n\nI don't think our social-DAO revenue model should require membership fees, however there will be signup fees for the professional bodies and transaction fees generated from member CPE activity. I'm looking at jurisdictions to launch it from. Currently in a tax-exempt charity that I co-founded in Australia, as a research project.

I'd love to take a defined style (anime comes to mind) see how much of it could be automated entirely.\n \nIdea: Create customizable nodes that the AI can recognize and improve upon. \nEven in an anime like Nichijou, which has a lot of variety despite its short length and slice-of-life focus, there's quite a few repeated types of building blocks (camera angles, arrangements of characters, settings/background, characters themselves, etc.). I've struggled getting consistent results from AI, but I'm not using templatized nodes like I am describing here.  Composing episodes then becomes a storyboarding exercise, with AI transforming those storyboards into consistent results.\n\nDo you guys already do this, or know of a tool that does?"

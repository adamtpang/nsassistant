It would be interesting to learn about how network and startup societies  -- which spawn membership globally -- could legally position themselves and protect themselves amid potentially stifling and conflicting nation state jurisdications as well as compliance measures. For example, if you were to start a network society as an entity, where do you register, and if you were to accept membership fees, where is that taxed?\n\nDo you find a small developing country and base it on their jurisdiction (e.g. Palau), do you go to a special zone and fork jurisdication (e.g. Prospera), do you find a regulation transparent boutique country with global outreach (e.g. Singapore), or do you stick with where most of your members come from (e.g. USA)?"

Needing and setting up a capital(virtual) comes up many times.\n- Is the population/real-estate/Annual income metric only important? Are there other metrics of importance?\n- Why do we discuss annual income here, not net worth, assets held like gold/BTC etc.\n- In the network state in 1000 words, 3rd step of the 7 steps of getting there:\n\"Build trust offline and a cryptoeconomy online, Begin holding in person meetups in the physical world, of increasing scale and duration, while simultaneously building an internal economy  using cryptocurrency\". Is this where what we are doing with the network school?\n\nI started chapter 2 as well, but it is even more information-dense.

Yoga, Climbing, other movement forms that stretch and tone seem to help.\n\nShunyata - Some Buddhist schools teach a technique called Shunyata, and it is practiced in conjunction with Vipassana. It is basically a meditation on emptiness. The final sutra in shiva sutras called \"Enter Space, Supportless, Eternal, Still\" evokes this similarly. Doing Shunyata makes you very, very still, almost in a state of letting go and really entering eternal space. Later when vipassana is done, there's a very different quality and depth to it. \n\nGiven our diverse group from different regions and faiths, it would be fascinating to share and explore new practices. Some ideas:\n\nInterfaith kirtan sessions?\nTrying new techniques from different traditions\nExploring movement-based meditations (Qi Gong, Tai Chi, Whirling, Yoga, etc.)"

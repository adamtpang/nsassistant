I press the button that says ‚Äúmocha.‚Äù The machine sputters, and the plastic nozzle protrudes toward my cup like a mosquito's proboscis. Creamy, delectable brown liquid flows gently into the cup. It is time. \n\nMore words are said. Incoherent. Incoherent. More dishes clink. Clink clink. The mass of bodies sitting at tables, standing and talking, wading around the room, all continue to move in a pseudo-choreographed manner. \n\nI take the sip! \n\n‚ÄúAh-ha!‚Äù \n\nI am back.\n\nI spin around. I say, ‚ÄúGood morning, friend.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt Chinese, after all. I can‚Äôt distinguish language in the post-caffeine mental dystopia. \n\nMaybe that is a problem."

I do not notice the food either, but it is piping hot, and the people I did not notice are chewing and swallowing it in a frenzy. Fellow network schoolers? I recognize the scent of mocha, and the smell begins titillating my taste buds. Moving from my room to elevator to floor took forever, like slouching slowly toward Bethlehem. All that matters now is the dopamine hit to sate the reward circuitry. I need the jolt. Since waking up, my brain has cried out, ‚Äúcaffeine, caffeine, caffeine.‚Äù  \n\nWhere is it? Ah, there it is. Close now. \n\nI see the throng undulating and writhing around me, an amoeba of colors and flesh penetrating the edges of my periphery. Dishes clank. Voices ‚Äî baritone and soprano ‚Äî disturb the airwaves. The blurry mass of bodies frolics everywhere, but their movement is insignificant in the scheme of things. Nothing matters until I get that beautiful pick-me-up, that sweet puckering of the soul that only comes with the ingestion of the preferred drug.  \n\nFinally, the machine; I reach out to grasp that little cup beside it.  \n\n‚ÄúGood morning, man.‚Äù \n\nOh, gosh. Oh fuck, I think a human wants to have a conversation. Now is not the time or the place for such things. How dare this person want to talk in this citadel of public exhibition! Especially since I have not had my taste. My hit. That sweet, sweet energizer. \n\nThe human gesticulates, concocts some words, utters them, and then stares at me. \n\nI am not rude, right? Now, I am terrified I am being uncivilized. I respond:\n\n‚ÄúGood morning, friend. Sorry, sorry, just need to grab my coffee. Give me one moment.‚Äù\n\nSounds emanate from his mouth, but the words might as well be in Chinese. Wait, maybe they are in Chinese?"

So if you start doing this and feel like it's too much (because of constant soreness, or your feet begin to hurt, or anywhere begins to hurt really) then the options are:\n1. Cut back on training 1, so less intensity work. Could do the first half of that training at higher pace, then the rest at easy pace.\n2. Do less actual running for the \"easy\" part and swap a part of it out with other forms of cardio. It partly transfers, so doing a stationary bike also kind of works, crosstrainer (elliptical) is even better than bike. Both mean less strain on your joints and such.\n\nThis above is the schedule that @undefined used to train for a recent half marathon."

I'd consider Isaac a member of The Network. In his own words from the article:\n\n> Given my general skepticism toward the government and mainstream narratives, I am very interested in looking into claims of fraud. I‚Äôm the same guy who believes the U.S. government is covering up some evidence of UFOs (partly because they‚Äôve recently admitted as much). I‚Äôm the kind of reporter who does not like to use ‚Äúcomments from intelligence officials‚Äù in my sourcing. I have no loyalty to either political party. [I created this media outlet to help bridge a divide](https://www.readtangle.com/how-im-fixing-political-news) between the right and left and get us all closer to a shared reality. I am, in a word, a skeptic seeking out something that‚Äôs as close to truth as possible.\n\nAlso, [an X thread](https://twitter.com/Ike_Saul/status/1324435797374808066?ref=readtangle.com) he created during the 2020 election, when he was hosting a bounty for credible claims of election fraud."

The only questionable thing is they sometimes use too much oil. I've noticed they've switched to butter, but in Asia, you can't always tell if it's butter or margarine, who knows? Also, I recently discovered they have boiled eggs now, so I've opted for those instead.‚Ä®\n\nBeside the egg station is the DIY noodle bar, and I just love their broth, probably full of MSG, but hey, it's delicious, right? I drop these at my table, then head to the fruit section, which usually has nothing left by the time I get there, so I pick yogurt instead. Too bad it's not Greek, and even worse, it's low-fat! Just as I'm about to leave the fruit station, a Malaysian staff member approaches from my right and puts out more yellow watermelons. I'm so glad he did, so I picked some, though today for some reason, many pieces taste weird, almost like they've been left in the sun too long before arriving.‚Ä®\n\nAnyway, my rounds are still going! this is usually the final one at the drink station. Normally, I don't drink juice, but I find a quarter glass is the sweet spot, especially when I haven't had fruit that day. Then I pour myself one cup of tea and one cup of soy milk, bring it back to the table and that's how I start my day!"

I usually go between 9:30 and 9:45, depending on the day, and I love the rush of heading down because I know food service is nearly over by then. I've noticed that the staff remember me and even my room number now, so I guess that's a good thing.‚Ä®\n\nI usually go straight to grab a big plate and do my rounds, carbs first (YES, this girl loves carbs!). Often, I run into fellow students doing their rounds too, so I stop for some small talk, smiling, nodding all that social stuff. Then I return to my mission: one spoon of Nasi dishes like fried rice or fried noodles, followed by a couple of pieces of chicken. I've been skipping the beef lately because it's pretty chewy, and I don't like to chew much. Then I pick my stir-fried veggies, dried shredded beef, sambal (of course!), and a couple of pieces of tempeh from that Indian curry dish I can't remember the name.‚Ä®\n\nAfter that, I do my round for more protein. Normally, I avoid processed food, but some days I'll take sausages and baked beans. Oh, and they have secret ingredients in the porridge section, salted duck eggs and century eggs! I‚Äôm a sucker for those two! Then I drop my plate at a small table since all the big tables are usually full of people who arrived earlier."

Surely the industrious hotel staff would remove the birds if they could, but there was nothing they could do. The chirping of the birds, out of place in doors, joined the noise of the bustling morning crowd of hungry guests. It was a little after 9 in the morning, and several grand round tables, seating at least a dozen people, were already full of black shirted men in their mid 30s. Filling in the space at smaller tables were elderly asian families, and a smattering of honeymooning couples. \n\nA shy woman in hijab greeted me to take my room number. She noted it down dutifully, and welcomed me into the breakfast buffet space. A tremendous square of various buffet containers occupied the central space. As has become my routine, I made my way to the \"egg corner\", waiting in line among other protein inclined gentlemen for my chance to submit my omelette order. \"An omelette with just peppers\", I requested when it was my turn. My order submitted, I was free to pursue my other interests. Namely, whatever red meat and luke warm curry sauce could be found in the usual place, on the other side of the buffet square.\n\nOn the way to acquire the beef randang, I dodged running children and indecisive honeymooners. Passing them, my mind flashed with wonder about why one would eat rice porridge for breakfast or what one would put dried sardines on top of. Clearly many of the buffet items were catering to ideas of breakfast that I would never share.\n\nAfter arriving at the silver trough containing my beef randang, I spooned the lukewarm meat and sauce on to a plate. My mind briefly wandered on the topic of how many hands had touched this spoon, and where those hands had been. In fact, where had my hands been? I pushed those thoughts from my mind and turned to find a place to rest my plate.\n\nOf the many round tables full of people, I now had to choose who would be my companions for this breakfast. Taking stock of the situation, I found myself drawn to the quiet intense conversation happening at a table full of my fellow students, and repelled by the raucous laughter coming from a more boisterous table. This made the decision easy and I set my plate down.\n\n\"Mind if I join you guys?\""

It‚Äôs not an easy term to define (as @undefined makes clear in various places, it‚Äôs a continuum / spectrum, not a fixed point).  Conversationally, sovereignty can be ‚Äúthe ability of a state, a people, or a network to chart and pursue their own course‚Äù.    \nSo, Perhaps contextualizing the economic issue in terms of ‚Äúis Milei increasing/decreasing the sovereignty of the Argentinian State & People with his actions?‚Äù  Since sovereignty is upstream from economic AND human flourishing.   \nDarren Beattie (controversial for sure, Fmr Trump speechwriter) wrote some important articles in 2021 dealing with cross-sovereign-state arbitrage re: servers, data centers, speech.  Without going into (controversial) detail, those articles might mark the last point of a public intellectual engaging in original thinking on the post WW2 world order.  Because he outlines the highest tiers of state sovereignty (in that post-war understanding) are full control of a Web 2.0 infrastructure.  We might understand this as an X-Y axis of visualizing sovereignty. (State, People)\nWhat Balaji does in TNS is add the Z axis (Network), which takes you from Super Mario Brothers on NES to Mario 64.   The first Original thinking from a public intellectual that leaves the post-WW2 order (and Kissinger‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorld Order‚Äù) structure in the past.\nThe point is this:  if Milei aims to pursue Sovereignty for the Argentinian State/People (which is upstream from economic & human prosperity, and the guarantor of prosperity) - the best tool at his disposal may be embracing the Z axis.  That doesn‚Äôt * just * mean crypto friendly state policy, but rather embracing, aligning, allying,  promoting the nascent network state(s).  In being a first mover on this, he would open up vast strategic optionality & depth for his State/People."

They weren‚Äôt durable. And these poor creatures were obsessed by the idea that everything that existed had to have a purpose, and that some purposes were higher than others. These creatures spent most of their time trying to find out what their purpose was. And every time they found out what seemed to be a purpose of themselves, the purpose seemed so low that the creatures were filled with disgust and shame. And, rather than serve such a low purpose, the creatures would make a machine to serve it. This left the creatures free to serve higher purposes.\n\nBut whenever they found a higher purpose, the purpose still wasn‚Äôt high enough. So machines were made to serve higher purposes, too. And the machines did everything so expertly that they were finally given the job of finding out what the highest purpose of the creatures could be. The machines reported in all honesty that the creatures couldn‚Äôt really be said to have any purpose at all. The creatures thereupon began slaying each other, because they hated purposeless things above all else. And they discovered that they weren‚Äôt even very good at slaying. So they turned that job over to the machines, too. And the machines finished up the job in less time than it takes to say, ‚ÄúTralfamadore‚Äù\n\nKurt Vonnegut, Sirens of Titan, 1959"

This is because we are nearing a technological inflection point, where advancements in medicine and technology will soon increase the average human lifespan by more than one year for every year that passes. This idea is known as longevity escape velocity.\n\nIn essence, as technology continues to improve, each year you stay alive means you‚Äôll benefit from new innovations that extend life even further. Thus, by taking care of your health and avoiding risks to your life as much as possible, your chances of living well beyond the current human lifespan dramatically increase, potentially extending your life for hundreds of years.\n\nIn the past, people might have said, ‚ÄúLiving a healthy life will only add a few more years, so why bother‚Äîbetter to live freely.‚Äù But now, those extra few years could make the difference between dying early and having the opportunity to live through multiple extended lifetimes‚Äîalmost like starting over or being reborn.\n\n(Source: a friend on X)"

This is nice bc it forces me to think about what I'll write about that week. It's usually a tweet and a LinkedIn post telling people I'll expand on x topic and to subscribe.\n3) Tuesday and Wednesday I spend some time in the newsletter. Sometimes it's as quick as 30minutes, other times it can take hours bc Im feeling blocked. That's where the information capture is so important.\n4) Thursday I usually pick the visuals and send it on **Beehiiv** + work on the post-newsletter content sharing some of the ideas from that week's newsletter. I usually do it in IG, Twitter and/or LinkedIn (I say \"or\" because some ideas are better for specific audiences)."

Wanted to formally establish a thread re: Drone piloting, practicing, racing, production, etc.\n\nI'm extremely new to all of this, but intent to learn from all who want to comment or inform here or in any in-person forum we establish. Caveat emptor on the below text.\n\nI've leaned on convos with @undefined , @undefined , @undefined and @undefined to advise on how to best proceed.\n---\n\nGoal:\n**Become competent drone operators.**\n\nYes, there are photography drones, but I think many that I've spoken to are quite interested in becoming great FPV drones. \n\nAs such, we'd likely want to train with headsets out in the wild. We'd train mostly for Drone v. Drone scenarios, but I think it'd also be fun to do Human v. Drone scenarios--see image below.\n\nBeing that drones are expensive, I think a logical first step is to practice on software. You can download the **DJI Virtual Flight App **on your phone to get a sense of the basic mechanics. And there are also a number of free and cheap software programs to practice on your comp.\n\nHere's the progression we could run:\nv1 = practice on phone/comp (free or cheap depending on program)\nv2 = practice on computer w/ compatible controller\nv3 = practice w/ full apparatus, single-pilot; headset, controller, drone (pending Malaysia airspace approval [if applicable])\nv4 = multi-pilot, irl PvP racing\nv5 (bonus) = Human v. Drone aka 'Drone Hunter'\n\nTo gamify this, perhaps we'd run a racing tourney in the coworking space (part of v2) to determine who gets dibs on piloting w/ full apparatus first irl."

It will help you set realistic, personalized, data-driven goals etc. Seeing detailed changes in your body composition (muscle gain or fat loss) can also be more motivating than just tracking weight on a regular scale IMO. \n\nAlso, knowing your bone density can reduce the risk of injury, because you can modify your training intensity to avoid overloading weak areas.

There is a case to be made for network states that move orthogonally to tech, where the focus is on the search for meaning and wisdom. Of course, high tech will inform social construction and network formation. The work of psychologist John Vervaeke really speaks to this idea of discovering wisdom in the age of the meaning crisis. If we are going to eventually be a space faring species, having a grasp of our psychology and motivations will be invaluable. The network state provides the initial conditions to fully explore our humanness in an age of unprecedented uncertainty."

When bitcoin started, nobody cared about bitcoin, they cared about paypal. \n\nWhat if the next silicon valley isn't software focused? After all, when Silicon valley started, the big thing was probably cars in Detroit.  Silicon valley had nothing to do with metal or cars. \n\nSo, maybe the next silicon valley isn't software focused or in one place. Maybe it's decentralized hardware production. Back to the future. I recently saw Peter Thiel talk about the importance of AI hardware but that he and silicon valley generally has expertise in software, not hardware. And that he wasn't sure what to invest in for AI hardware. \n\nOr, maybe it is redifining how we look at and value land. Much the same way bitcoin re-defined how we think about assets, self custody, etc."

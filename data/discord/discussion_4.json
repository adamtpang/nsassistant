It's in beta, and it's free (although I'm paying for the tokens so if you want to contribute there's a stripe link :P) \n-  As an extra, I created a tool that automates the writing of the \"Readme\" that you need to submit a bounty (the video explains how that works). So if you make a video with it, you don't need to worry about that part!\n\nAttached a few of the videos I created with the app. Let me know if you create videos with it, I'd love to see!"

MSTR went up way more than BTC, $540 and a crazy high nav premium, i think over 4.0, its back down to $410 today.\n\nI can see 2 scenarios the first is it just got way too high too quick with fomo of not getting in below $100k BTC and it has just reverted to the mean/sanity perhaps prompted by Citadel.  The second scenario is the (justified imo) mania has continued but Saylor has been doing a lot of ATM share issues and is buying lots more BTC right now.

Many people were saying that they had not been to a conference that was so ashtetically put together (decorations, lightening, the design, the vibe, spaces layout) with so much forethought, and I loved seeing the integration of Thai culture into the vibe of the entire venue.. all the way from the chill/resting places to the boardrooms. And the boardrooms also had water, paper notes, pens, and the film/production teams seemed to be running a tight ship for the online streaming, so so thoughtful and organized. Also, the decompressing room was the best thing ever, to allow people to rest in beds, stretch, get massages, wind down.. this was gold for those being jetlagged. \n\nAs for the food, I was so amazed by the variety of it, plus the drinks, desserts, snacks (people also said other conferences had not been generous as Devcon with providing food all day basically). \n\nAlso, the programming was filled with everything (pick your own adventure basically) and there was content for anything and so much happening every hour with a lot of interesting people all around, great companies with all crazy sorts of products and tests going on. It was a total multi-day festival basically. \n\nIt was cool to see different programs from talks, panels, small circle conversations, breakout rooms, lightening talks, hall vendors. Also the branding of the decks looked pretty standarized and consistent overall. And the website was super helpful for using the filters based on proficency, types of events, etc to narrow down what to go vs not on a personal level.\n\nFor me, i wish i could have tried even more things as there was so much to do, so I'll def go back and watch online some stuff I missed üíÉ . So, amazing job at putting it together @undefined , I can't imagine the legwork it took to run üí™"

To an extent, one could argue that the startup society movement is a competitor to MAGA (exit your nation state instead of staying, while being sympathetic to similar issues).

(To be fair, the US is a bit different in that individual states have different approaches.)  Ironically, one would be curious if some of those in the left who are now saying they want to leave the US actually leave and start their own startup societies?

    "content": "And then I saw this one (called Longevity God or Shou Xing in Chinese) in Vietnam and then I asked ChatGPT :\n\nThe elongated head of Shou Xing in Chinese mythology doesn‚Äôt appear directly related to specific long-headed beings from other ancient civilisations. However, elongated heads have appeared in several ancient cultures, often symbolising distinctiveness, wisdom, or a connection to the divine, though usually for different reasons.\n\nFor example:\n    1.    Ancient Egypt: Some depictions of the Pharaoh Akhenaten and his family feature elongated heads, which have led some to speculate about symbolic, religious, or even physiological reasons behind these representations. However, in this context, the elongated head likely signified royal divinity or uniqueness rather than specifically longevity.\n    2.    Paracas Culture in Peru: The Paracas people practiced cranial elongation, where infants‚Äô skulls were deliberately shaped to have elongated heads. This was possibly a status symbol or a marker of social class rather than an association with any specific deity or attribute like longevity.\n    3.    Olmec and Maya Civilisations: Skull elongation was also practiced by some Mesoamerican cultures for ritual and social purposes, symbolising beauty, nobility, or even a connection to gods. However, there is no clear connection to longevity or divine wisdom as in the case of Shou Xing.\n\nShou Xing‚Äôs elongated head, then, seems unique in its specific symbolism of wisdom and longevity within the context of Chinese culture. While it visually resonates with other ancient depictions of elongated heads, it doesn‚Äôt share a direct link with the religious or cultural practices of other civilisations."

My hope was that I would finish it soon enough for members to be able to use it to get some bounties. \n\nToday I have finished a super-beta version, and I thought I'd do a soft-launch with this community. \n\nI think the Shorts it generates are quite good for the time you'll invest, but the good thing is that you can create many with very little effort.\n\nAs you know, the models have a cost to run, but the first 10$ of USD (20 videos or so) are on me\n\nHere's a video of me explaining how the app works: https://www.loom.com/share/ca09e7efe32748fbae8b4e4982041b23?sid=afc80c7d-b4f0-4ca4-a343-b208f4a853a1\n\nFor sure there are lots of bugs and things to improve, and I'd love to hear about them! In fact, I already share a few things that don't work on the video.\n\nAlso, as @undefined recommends often, the human touch is key. You should make a script that you like and also use the Director's notes to direct what you want to happen in the video.\n\nI attach the video I created during the demo (plus two extra with 2 different styles so that you can see the possibilities)\n\n**If you want to try it, send me a DM with your email and I'll create a user for you! The first 20 videos are on me, and you're more than welcome to use it to collect bounties!**"

Big respect for Balaji @undefined for the understanding and balanced views on a part of the world that tends to elicit polarized responses. And big respect for NS members who are taking this field trip. I will not be able to be in China at that exact time but I would be happy to answer any questions via Discord pm if needed.\n\nPeople to people exchanges are important for peace. Although many of us are sympathetic to red America‚Äôs issues (I am as well), an aggressive push by Trump administration on China could have ripple effects on the Asia-Pacific region, of which Forest City is a part of. Trade conflicts aside ‚Äî which arguably have their reasons ‚Äî the one big area that concerns me is the potential erosion or limitation of people-to-people exchanges. \n\nLike India, China is arguably a ‚Äúsubcontinent‚Äù, home to a population roughly equal to the total size of US + the entire European Union + all of ASEAN, with close to 100 cities that have populations of 5 million or more (roughly ~100 x Phoenix Arizonas). Let that sink in. When the next fiery senator from America talks about a ‚Äúcrusade against Communists‚Äù from an ivory tower on Capitol Hill ‚Äî whether it be Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio, or Marsha Blackburn ‚Äî keep in mind that the audience listening also includes hundreds of millions of youth in China born after 2005 ‚Äî roughly more than the total population of the United States ‚Äî who no longer admire the West and grow up under constant reminder that their nation is being condemned.  That is a lot of enemies being made. Judging from how the Century of Humiliation, Opium Wars, and Sino-Japanese War are remembered‚Ä¶people have a very long, intergenerational memory.\n\nSo‚Ä¶people-to-people exchanges are so important. A lot of respect for those NSers who are visiting China. P.S. Recommending visiting Yiwu, the factory citiy where almost all of our stuff from Lazada, Shoppee, Amazon, etc come from. Talk to the folks on the ground at booths and shops. You will likely contribute more to world peace than the US senators in that ivory tower."

But now, it‚Äôs transformed into a thriving destination filled with caf√©s, boutiques, and creative spaces that attract both locals and tourists.\n\nThis concept got me thinking about the potential of our distressed properties. While it‚Äôs not an immediate need, for V4 or V5, it could be powerful to convert these spaces into destinations that serve not only our members but also visitors and locals who seek unique, community-driven experiences. \n\nTying this to the timing of the next Network State Conference could also generate extra buzz and draw attention, turning these spaces into a blend of functionality and appeal, which could elevate our school‚Äôs visibility, adding a layer of cultural and economic value."

This is by the way the region where Forest City is located. A maximum pressure press from Trump admin hawks on China ‚Äî which could see itself backed to a corner amid economic crisis and needing to assure 1.4 billion domestic audience of strength ‚Äî could invoke a violent reaction from the other side. That is not good for Asia and ASEAN, which could absorb much of the collateral damage. Peace through strength turns into ripple effect violence that will wipe out a lot of things. There may be an eventual phone call btw Xi and Trump that settles things in deal making fashion, but a lot of people (over ~2 billion along or inside the the Pacific first island chain) and businesses could be on knife‚Äôs edge before that happens.\n2. Again, in a way, the startup society movement is arguably a competitor to MAGA (exit instead of staying, while being sympathetic to similar issues). The more disgruntled people are with election results, the more attractive this movement is as a viable alternative. Now, is this movement also ready to embrace ‚Äúblue‚Äù American never-Trumpers who could exit? Hypothetical network state based on abortion commandment?"

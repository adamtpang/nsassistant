Plus crypto payments align with our ideas. \n\nCould we partner with a Malaysian Fintech or crypto company to create crypto addresses that auto-sell to local fiat? Maybe Grab would be interested? \n\nBasically, merchants could have an app/centralized wallet, customers could pay them in crypto, and then the merchant could configure it to autosell the crypto to their local currency. \n\nThis seems like a good starting point to get local merchants to accept crypto. \n\nMight also be a good opportunity for Network School attendees to interact with local businesses."

They installed a new tank about 30 minutes ago and says it takes about 2 hours before the tank reaches the requisite temperature to heat all the water and keep it clear. So if by midnight you're still having a water problem (dirty or cold), please call me at +1 919 491 1947. I saw the tank and it's currently about 40% of the temperature it needs to be, but it's rising. Give it another few hours and it should work.\n\nMeanwhile, if you need a shower, I just checked the water in my room and it's fine. You're welcome to use my bathroom if you'd like.\n\nThat being said, this happened once before guests arrived and the tank change fix DID work and I would imagine that the water is fine in an hour or two. Ping me if that is not the case.\n\ncc @undefined @undefined @undefined @undefined @undefined @undefined @undefined @undefined \n\nAlso in general, the FASTEST way to fix something with the rooms is just to DM me on Discord or message me on Whatsapp. I've built good relationships with the head of housekeeping and the head of maintenance. I have their numbers and they generally respond pretty fast. \n\nYou can also use ns.com/feedback for something less urgent. Thanks üôÇ"

If it turns out to be tricky to get things lined up perfectly without a human involved, it is actually quite easy to manually remove the background and center it appropriately behind a freshly generated background.\n\nPerhaps we could ask at the next all-hands to see if anyone in the community has the background to create something like PhotoAI in-house. I know a lot of the software engineers at NS *could* do this with enough time and resources, but it would be great if someone already had the relevant background.\n\nI mean, if Peter can do this by himself... At the very least, maybe Peter could provide the \"shortest path\" given we want a much simpler \"product\" (just create a photo realistic profile photo based on some inputs, without the bells-and-whistles of PhotoAI)\n\n@undefined Could you perhaps work on a few prompts to create 3 - 5 styles of \"anonymous\" profile pictures in Midjourney?"

It's math. 70% nutrition, 30% exercise: you can't outrun a bad diet.\nFit life is better üòâ\n\nMy motivation to do this here and now: \n- The hardest part to stay on track is that your social environment may not be beneficial: NS.com is the best place to stick to it by making conscious choices.\n- It's a process and we can piece by piece replace the food we crave with the food we need.\n- Our bodies are all different. Some of us don't have strict training regime (yet). 3 months are enough time for dramatic change but it takes a little to really kick in.\n\n(I don't post much about me online but I will find some before after pictures that I usually don't disclose.)"

Start a conversation with ChatGPT.\n\n2. Describe your project needs, ending with: \"Don't start coding; we are in the planning stage. Ask any clarifying questions to understand the problem.\"\n\n3. Engage in Q&A with ChatGPT until it fully understands your requirements. Make assumptions when necessary.\n\n4. Use the prompt: \"Use all we've talked about to make a terse description of the requirements\" to get a final summary.\n\n5. Copy and paste that summary into a new ChatGPT conversation.\n\n6. Ask ChatGPT to \"brainstorm 10 ideas\" for improving the system or making it more useful for a specific use case.\n\n7. Again, use the prompt: \"Use all we've talked about to make a terse description of the requirements\" to get an updated final summary.\n\n8. Use the final summary with a prompt like: \"Let's take this project summary and flesh it out into a full project plan.\"\n\n9. Manually edit the full project plan (final polish step).\n\n10. Submit the polished full project plan to Discord."

Garmin Fanboy but this is due to outdoor and endurance exercise.\n\nLongevity: For constant tracking non Obstrusive.\nSportactivity/Training: Depends on the sport.\n\nFitbit shut down, so don't buy even if cheap.\n\nSubscription models:\n- Whoop: got one before coming here. super good. wear it all the time and not distracting. quite steep price for me. focus is on how you feel daily. app is very well done. supportive not intrusive. Can be charged while wearing üòÑ 260$/year. Additional wristbands 40-50$ each. Bought as a good friend swears on it and I want to collect as much Bryan Johnson energy as possible. Comfortable to wear while sleeping. Autodetects workouts.\n- Oura: never tried as i don't wear rings. Heard data quality is better than Whoop, but this is probably optimizing on the far right curve already. 300-350$ for the ring, 6$ per month for the membership. So after 1 year cheaper than Whoop.\n\nWatches:\n- Garmin: I have a Fenix 6, but I use it mainly to keep me alive in the outdoors. No apps, no distractions, multi day/week battery life. Great for more exotic sport tracking, work out planning scheduling, reports a lot of stats, great to work with a coach with to share data. Works by itself, no phone needed. New models. Cost depending on model 450-1000 USD (Fenix 7, Fenix 8 series). Garmin Ecosystem has tons of specialised watches for fitness, running, pilots, divers, golf, sailors, combat etc. all with different price points. The even have one in the 4k range to not look to cheap for people wearing suits. Fenix series is for me the best given lifestyle and it's still going strong after 4 years of adventures. I don't wear it all the time, take it off for sleeping.\n- Apple Watch: needs an iphone. Short battery life. Sensors are super good. Can be used for tons of other things as well. Never had one. Maybe I am missing out. Not sure about price here as well. You can talk with it, can assist in other ways. Sensors top class as well."

After all, if we don't understand the Nation State, how do we implement successful parallel governance models?  \n\n\nI'll likewise cover a deeper history (to support @undefined's work) of the network state idea, starting with the 19th century obscure concept of \"panarchy.\" Read the event description for more details about the talk's contents. \n\nhttps://lu.ma/50ijr4xx (please sign up here) \n\nI also want to support other speakers and network state literati who seek to conduct talks and innovate around the network state ideation space. Happy to mentor, collaborate, and learn from others --- as well as support your talks. After all, this is a community effort. \n\nIndeed, science was not built by one towering genius, but instead worked out via distributed cognition and the expansive curiosity of the human imagination."

Please write your name down when you check out any stuff from there and make sure to return it.\n\n**Table tennis**: 13th floor, turn right after the elevators, walk to the room all the way at the end.\n**Volleyball**: there's a net on the beach, if you go down to the pool just keep walking straight to the beach, it's a bit to the right when you exit but you'll see it.\n**Basketball**: two fields here https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYzjDAPcA6wU92kt5, one here https://maps.app.goo.gl/eCQBvpExyAWgG7kw7. Both on the way to the NS Co-working space.\n**Football**:  could of course play beach football on the beach, https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z3jCjHpLFincFj2z8  (on the way to NS Co-working) is a basketball court with a cage surrounding it so the football doesn't fly off into any windows so is the best non-sandy option.

Firstly we talked about how we would approach writing the Network State song, here are the ideas that we came up with: \n- As this is a community project, we want to involve as many people as possible. It will be great to have short interviews where we ask people some questions. These will then help us come up with lyrical ideas for the song. \n- Some of the questions we had in mind were: \n1. Why do you think the Network State is important? \n2. What made you come here? \n3. Where do you come from? \n4. Could you please say: ‚Äòwin and help win‚Äô or ‚Äòtruth, health, wealth‚Äô in your native language? \n- We are also planning to make a short video of the interviews as well as song Behind the Scenes of the making process that would go along with the song as a memory. \n- Maybe we can think about minting NFTs for this, but more discussion and clarity needs to be achieved on this front. \n\nWe also asked Vitalik about how he would envision a  song for the Network School to sound like and he said this: ‚ÄòYou have to make it sound nice, even if someone is in a restaurant and can‚Äôt hear the lyrics it should sound pleasing to the ears.‚Äô \nSo even though we are working on the lyrical aspect a lot, it is important to keep in mind that it should sound good musically. A lot of time should be allocated to that. We would need good music production and composition and not just good lyric writing. \n\nFeel free to give any ideas or suggestions."

Find and study the OpenAI documentation on \"structured outputs\":\n   - Understand how to specify a JSON object schema for the output\n   - Learn how to include the `response_format` parameter in your API call\n\n2. Complete two warm-up exercises using structured output:\n   - Warm-up 1: Get nutritional information for a food item\n   - Warm-up 2: Score a celebrity on various criteria\n\n3. Create your own unique structured output scenario:\n   - Design a JSON schema for a topic of your choice\n   - Implement the API call with your custom schema\n   - This is the primary task - be creative!\n\n4. Display the JSON responses:\n   - Use `json.dumps()` with the `indent` parameter to format the output\n   - Print the formatted JSON to the console using print statements\n\n## Why This Matters\n- Learn how to work with structured data in AI responses\n- Gain experience in specifying output formats for AI models\n- Understand the benefits of structured output for data processing and analysis\n- Prepare for more advanced AI integration in future projects\n\n## Tips\n- Start with simple JSON structures and gradually increase complexity\n- Experiment with different prompts and schemas to see how the AI adapts its output\n- Think about real-world applications where structured output could be useful"

Cursor also has AI features and can use your files for context. I love it\nPython: I have python installed on my local machine. You can watch tutorials online for this.\nTerminal (macOS): I used terminal to run the program and did not build any UI. PC users can google \"how to run python programs on windows\". Most likely you will start with cmd (command prompt). \n\nI did not use replit for this one because I already had python installed, an IDE installed, and this was a very simple script that could be done in 1 or 2 python files.  \n\nHope this helps."

Also great for actual training plans and advanced features. It's my adventure watch.\n\nI got a Whoop for the experiment here and must say it's much much better for sleep tracking etc. and general well being. Friend of mine swears on it to see when he get's sick before he has actual symptoms. My preference over Oura is simply that I don't have ever worn rings.

You can laugh, cry, shout, express yourself vocally, if there's a song with lyrics you can sing along, but no talking with each other. \n3. You're sober, no alcohol or drugs. \n4. No judgement. Not of yourself nor of others. You can move and dance if you want, the way you want. You can meditate. \n5. We're all very serious and important people here, yet I invite you to be playful, funny, drop your inhibitions, and flow. No need to ignore thoughts and emotions that come up, notice them, and remember that they come and go. And let them go üôÇ\n6. I would like this to be a safe and closed container. Please arrive on time. Once the music has started I would ask no new people to come in as that may affect the safety, bring back up our inhibitions and put us on guard.\n\nThose are just suggestions, I have no intent to enforce them, but my experience is that it makes a nicer experience if we do try to üòä"

    "content": "For folks that weren't around, a summary of the discussion we had after Bryan's talk:\n\nA primary challenge is getting the relevant data from the Farcaster network, so you can then create visualizations from it.\n\n**The simplest way to do this** is to use existing (paid) services like [Neynar](https://neynar.com/) and [Dune](https://dune.com/home), querying their APIs for the data you need.\n\n**The more complicated approach** is to run your own Farcaster \"node\" (that is, a piece of software that reads every piece of data added to the Farcaster network). You can do this with a piece of software called [Hubble](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/hubble/hubble). However, the data still won't be in a format you can actually use. One approach is to use the [Shuttle](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo/tree/main/packages/shuttle) library, which can connect to a Hubble node and stream data from the node to a Postgres database. Finally, you can write SQL queries from your application to massage the data from Postgres database into a format you can use to create visualizations.\n\nHappy to answer any questions for folks that are newer to software development that want to understand any part of this."

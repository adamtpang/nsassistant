But I wish I could submit feedback without being required to **1.** give an NPS score **2.** input decisions about staying at NS past Dec 23 and **3.** provide an email.\n\nWhen I provide an NPS score and \"past Dec 23rd\" decision, I feel like it seems like those data points are the most important part of the submission. However, every time I've filled this form out, I've wanted the focus to be on the feedback itself (not NPS score). I don't think this is your intention, but I think it's also easy to start wondering if the feedback is only considered based on how you score the NPS and how you mark the \"past Dec 23rd\" question. If y'all are doing a Superhuman-style PMF-metric on the feedback and that's why you're collecting this, I get it. But, as a community member, it just feels like a lot to categorize myself this way when I want to share feedback. **The net result is friction to using `/feedback`**.\n\nAlso, I'm sure you're missing out on valuable feedback from folks by requiring an email address to submit the form. I can understand the pros-and-cons of allowing anonymous feedback, but I think there's important signal you're not getting because of this. **Again, the net result is friction to using `/feedback`**.\n\nAs a last note — it would be great to know if y'all actually have the bandwidth to regularly review `/feedback` at the moment. It would be fine if the honest answer was \"no\", but would be good to know and set expectations."

It's better to finish strong then to start to fast, get cramp, tear muscle etc. (I had all of this on my road bike race 5km in. never had an issue with this in non race environment. thankfully had enough experience to go through the pain and could finish). \n- In the week before you have taper week and load will go down to leverage hyper compensation of the body to be in peak \"form\".\n- Always always always put your health first. \n- Stretch a lot, best daily for 30 minutes.\n\nI was so dialed in on my race that the week after 2 days of rest I was still riding the most I have done in my life even while training for the big event. It was effortless. That was the real achievement.\n\nSo take it easy. Listen to your body."

It was discussed at length around the 2014s by the ethereum community (vitalik made a blogpost about it) and other great minds (raph merkle wrote a pice on it) but it only got implemented for the first time around eoy 2023. We were lucky to participate in the birth and early contribution of the project, we are very passionate about this. If that's something that could interest some of you, let us know!\n\nBet on value, trade on belief: https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html\nIn this blogpost, Hanson argues that we should bet on value (set goals) but use markets to find the most efficient way to achieve these goals. Futarchy is a paradigm shift for governance and imo the most interesting experiment happening rn in crypto 🔥"

Also a note for hygiene, my old coach used to tell us to always carry a small bottle of alcohol hand sanitizer with us and make sure to wash hands consistently, there is no easier way to ruin training than to get ill so take extra precautions!"

Apply the code at checkout.\n\n(2) *Disclaimer*: Our team encountered issues with Blueprint Protein Powder and are having to remake it. So, the website will not allow you to buy it at the moment, but you can join the waitlist (https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/protein?variant=48973070795037). Otherwise, for protein options, you can purchase the Nutty Pudding Mix (https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/nutty-pudding-protein-mix), and we'll be launching a Macadamia Protein Bar soon (https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/macadamia-protein-bar?variant=49185238745373).\n\n(3) Talked with our ops team, and at the moment, it's much better to do individual orders than group orders. This is the v1 way to have Blueprint products at the Network School. Future iterations plan on having easier options and allowing for buying on-site. Will keep everyone in the loop for that.\n\n(4) Action Item: each of you should do the following...\n1. Visit the Blueprint website: https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/.\n2. Add any / all items to cart you'd like (besides Blueprint Protein).\n3. Go to checkout and apply the 'NetworkSchool10' discount code for 10% off.\n\n*Delivery address:*\nAddress: Forest City Marina Hotel, Jalan Forest City 1, Pulau Satu\nState: Johor, City: Gelang Patah, Postcode: 81550\n\nDM me if you have any questions."

Previously 1/100 cards would cost a min of $500+ to build a basic team and start playing but once they moved to Stark net they introduced a new 1/1000 rarity meaning anybody could get started playing with $50 for a basic team.

    "content": "If anyone needs that extra push, this is what's motivating me (highly recommend the book, by the way):\n\n\"The concept of Misogi, as explored in Michael Easter’s book The Comfort Crisis, is a Japanese tradition that involves a physically and mentally grueling challenge designed to push a person far beyond their comfort zone. It’s rooted in ancient purification rituals that were often physically demanding, involving tasks like walking through cold rivers or climbing mountains. The modern interpretation of Misogi, which Easter applies in the context of personal growth, is more metaphorical—it’s about taking on a challenge that seems nearly impossible, where the odds of failure are high but the goal is to test your limits and grow through discomfort.\n\n**Key Elements of Modern Misogi:**\n\n**1.** Uncomfortable Challenge: It should be something so difficult that there’s a good chance you might not finish it. It’s about finding the edges of your physical and mental endurance.\n\n**2.** Growth Through Discomfort: By facing these extreme challenges, you grow stronger and more resilient, learning what you’re capable of when pushed to your limits.\n\n**3.** Minimal Rules: Easter’s version of Misogi has two rules:\n\n*-> You should be unsure if you can complete the challenge (about a 50/50 chance of success).*\n*-> Don’t die.*\n\n**4.** Connection to the Modern World: Easter argues that modern society is too comfortable. We no longer face the physical and mental struggles our ancestors did, so we need to manufacture our own challenges to grow. Misogi offers a way to inject meaningful difficulty into our lives to improve resilience, mental clarity, and overall fulfillment.\n\nIn The Comfort Crisis, Misogi serves as a way to challenge the body and mind in extreme ways, creating moments of profound growth and self-discovery. The idea is that by enduring discomfort, you can escape the \"comfort zone\" that dominates modern life, leading to a stronger, more capable version of yourself.\""

So if you start doing this and feel like it's too much (because of constant soreness, or your feet begin to hurt, or anywhere begins to hurt really) then the options are:\nCut back on training 1, so less intensity work. Could do the first half of that training at higher pace, then the rest at easy pace.\nDo less actual running for the \"easy\" part and swap a part of it out with other forms of cardio. It partly transfers, so doing a stationary bike also kind of works, crosstrainer (elliptical) is even better than bike. Both mean less strain on your joints and such.\n\nThis above is the schedule that @undefined used to train for a recent half marathon."

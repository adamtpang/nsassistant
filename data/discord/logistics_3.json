DM me your preferred payment method ([see options](https://discord.com/channels/900827411917201418/1285028917857488998/1285239608023711844)).**\n\nIt’s not required to understand the calculations in the sheet, but there are some details below.\n\n**Details:**\nThe shipping costs for our order were more expensive than the total shipping costs would have been if we placed 22 separate orders. In this sense, we lost money on shipping. I calculated the shipping cost of the 22 individual orders to understand the exact loss.\n\nThe good news is we saved more with our 10% NS discount than we lost in shipping.\n\nI’ve decided to cover our shipping losses with the discount. After this, our remaining discount is equivalent to a 5.5% discount on the whole order.\n\n**The final result is equivalent to if everyone made their own order and got a 5.5% discount.**\n\nWith this approach, everyone saves money, everyone is accountable for what they would have paid in shipping on their own, and no one is disadvantaged for having made a larger or smaller order.\n\nI considered alternative ways to split the costs. I’m happy to discuss them, but it would be quite a bit more work for me to lay out the considerations in a concise, clear way. So I’m going to forego that for now. I’m happy to answer specific questions.\n\nAn interesting side note — most of the blueprint product prices have changed by 1 - 4 MYR since we placed our order."

I expect to provide some additional budget to augment the experience.\n\n# Food \nI've worked with a nutrionist for 3 months this year to get me ready for a sport event. Lost 14 kg while eating healthy and much more consistently.\nProcess included tracking everything I ate or cooked in myfitnesspal app to understand if I hit macros and calories. My fitness age is -5 years my biological age (Garmin watch data). Wasn't fun eating like this, but will do that again when at Network School (accountability buddies welcome).\nI am not vegan but am looking forward to do the blue print experiment. Main concern is that I need my proteins and don't like to have them from powders.\n\n# Laundry\nIf hotel laundry then pricey. Also prefer to have my own laundry vs. delegating that. Asia usually has good laundry services but I could not find any so far for Forest City."

Simply put, has anyone done visa runs from Malaysia?\n\nI lived in Singapore between 2009-2015, and back then, family & friends faced questioning when repeatedly entering/exiting SG on short-term visas, especially after doing quick turnarounds from a single country. Each entry granted a 30-day stay which could be extended up to 3 times, however frequent re-entries often led to scrutiny, particularly at land(Malaysia) and ferry(Indonesia) crossings. Also, after the 2/3 entry they were given a warning to return to their country by a certain date. \n\nNot sure if Malaysia has similar practices. I know it ultimately depends on the immigration officer, but I’d appreciate any insights or recent experiences with this.  Thanks"

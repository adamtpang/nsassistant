The straight collapse theory arguably does not work on America, doomers should not count out America.\n\nIn terms of historical arc, what may play out (just a theory and hypothesis) in the super long term for America is a Rome trajectory. After \"Crisis of the Third Century\", there was the Constantine revival of the 4th Century, before further decline and splinter in the 5th Century, followed by the Justinian restoration in the 6th Century, and then followed by the crises and losses of 7th Century, then restoration via Basil, then the disaster at Manizkert in the 11th Century, followed by the Komenoei restoration of the 12th Century...and it goes on until that Constantinople moment in 1453. More than one thousand years.\n\nIt''s like a stock chart where every decline after a while sees a strong rebound, but the rebound may spell a lower high compared to the previous cycle's rebound."

It‚Äôs called ‚Äúboiling a frog‚Äù. Cutting a potential rival off often back fires into the very thing that one tries to prevent ‚Äî because it incentivizes independence and nothing-to-lose mentality from the other side."

    "content": "The American resilience and confidence is admirable. Reminds me of Rome during the Punic Wars. Never count out Rome/America. When Hannibal marched to the gates of Rome, no Roman talked about surrender or appeasing the Carthgenians (compared to how later Carthage appeased Rome to the point of even driving out Hannibal). That confidence is energizing and captivating. You just don‚Äôt count out America or Americans.\n\nOn the other hand, the confidence arises from America arguably not having really experienced its full historical arc yet. Aside from a brief scare in 1812, America has never lost its core and never been existentially challenged ‚Äî yes, it is blessed geographically ‚Äî and Civil War, as brutal as it was, doesn‚Äôt compare to the brutality of Poland being carved out completely, or Soviet Russia during Barbarossa, or any number of atrocities experienced by many European/Asian nations during their longer historical arcs. WWI, WWII, Cold War etc were competitions that did not threathen the American heartland (again, blessed geographically). Competition with China is also far from the heartland.\n\nThe Roman in 180 AD was confident in Pax Romana, the Han Chinese in 180 AD was confident of Han Dynasty‚Äôs eternal mandate, but neither forsaw the Crisis of the Third Century. It took the East Romans losing Anatolian heartland after Manzikert and the Han Chinese having 80% of central plains decimated by Mongol invasions to realize that they were not exceptional at all."

Some humans haven‚Äôt learned that they can have agency and win. Germans are brought up in a different environment than Americans you can say. It could be their culture. They didn‚Äôt act during Covid like Americans yeah. Maybe that mindset is because the German govt pampers its population? Maybe it‚Äôs because during Covid Germans trusted their government a lot more than Americans? Idk. \n\nI agree with you that culture truly has had an impact on the American success. Also wanna say that all humans have the basic instincts of survival etc, guess some of us have learned what‚Äôs possible and some haven‚Äôt.

During COVID, mush (most?) of Munich was literally on house arrest from 1700-0900....people weren't allowed to go to the fucking park. now, this also happened in some places in America, but those places were predominantly controlled by democrats (eg California, NYC). in rural or red (republican) areas, that absolutely did not happen...cities reopened to 'business as normal' within a few weeks or months. the average German does not have this mindset and i'd guess that the average Chinese citizen, who's been conditioned, by violence, since Mao to do exactly what they're told have similar behavior patterns to the Germans. there are many such countries i think.\n\nright or wrong (i think right), the American mindset, on average, is different than that of the average German or Chinese or Japanese citizen, which has led to American flourishing, while, for example, Europe is drowning. the US and the EU are both 'the west' and have similar roots, but one is doing far better than the other and it's because they have different mindsets."

Close to 25% of Russia is not ethnic Russian. A republic within the Russian Federation also does not arguably operate in the same sense of a US state or a Chinese province...there is arguably more autonomy is certain cases, which lends an additional dimension to how Russia operates."

Above all, the objective of this politics by other means was to stop the rise of Donald Trump and the populism he represents. But that war failed; now Trump is back and, as Vance warned the political and military leaders assembled in Munich, ‚Äúthere is a new sheriff in town‚Äù in Washington.\"\n\nI don't think that Lyons particularly 'likes' Trump and his methods, but he does seem to be rather more clear-eyed than most commentators (and very well read) and he helps me see things from a new perspective, even if the truth is somewhere in the middle."

It would take a lot more to split the two on a fundamental level due to critical infrastructure that is joined.\n\nWhat would be likely in the short-to-mid term is Putin taking advantage of the situation to get concessions from Trump MAGA."

It's a bit like how your brain might notice that after it rains, the temperature usually drops - but way more complicated!\nThey use something called a \"Transformer\" (similar to what powers AI like ChatGPT), but they made special changes to make it work better with time series data.\nWhat can it do?\nSundial can:\n\nPredict energy usage\nForecast weather patterns\nGuess future sales\nAnd lots more!\n\nThe coolest part is that when they tested it against other prediction programs, Sundial did better than almost all of them - even though the other programs had to be specially trained for each specific prediction task!\nWhy does this matter?\nImagine if you're planning how much electricity your city needs next week, or how many ice cream cones to make at your shop tomorrow. Having good predictions helps you make better decisions. And since Sundial shows you several possible futures (not just one), you can better prepare for different possibilities!"

The concept of \"society as a service\" emerged, with discussion of how to prevent profit motives from corrupting the user experience or sacrificing the community's needs.\n\n12. Members debated the balance between idealism and practicality in creating new societies, especially regarding economic sustainability.\n\n13. The group discussed the concept of \"parallel societies\" that could provide alternative services as existing institutions decline or fail to meet needs.\n\n14. Participants emphasized the need for iterative development and MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approaches to building societies, starting small but with complete systems.\n\n15. The accessibility of startup societies was questioned - whether they would be limited to elites or could be made accessible to those with talent but limited financial resources.\n\n16. Energy independence and infrastructure were identified as critical considerations for physical resilience of network states.\n\n17. The importance of having a \"common vision\" was highlighted as a unifying factor that traditional governments often fail to provide.\n\n18. Several speakers noted the value of maintaining diversity of societal options rather than trying to create one perfect society for everyone.\n\n19. The concept of an expiration date for moral standards was proposed, allowing societies to periodically revisit and update their values rather than becoming rigid.\n\n20. The group discussed how crypto properties and values might be applied to governance systems to create more transparent, fair, and uncorruptible societies."

The group explored whether a \"new country\" is the necessary end state of a community or startup society, or if societies can exist solely to create moral innovation without aspiring to statehood.\n\n2. Startup societies were discussed as building blocks or foundations for potential network states, with the focus on creating effective templates that could be replicated.\n\n3. Balaji Srinivasan's concept of \"moral innovation\" was examined - the idea that founders of startup societies are \"moral entrepreneurs\" offering potential citizens a better way of life by correcting something the broader world has gotten wrong.\n\n4. Multiple speakers highlighted the importance of creating societies that prioritize individual happiness and well-being rather than focusing exclusively on economic metrics like GDP.\n\n5. The group discussed how startup societies could differentiate themselves from businesses or governments by having different values, goals, and incentive structures.\n\n6. Participants explored how transparency and governance systems could be improved using blockchain-like properties (permissionless, uncorruptible, transparent, verifiable systems).\n\n7. Resilience was identified as an essential quality for startup societies - being able to withstand external pressures and attacks, similar to how Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience.\n\n8. The group debated various metrics to measure a society's success beyond economic outcomes, including well-being indexes, retention rates, and adoption metrics.\n\n9. Several members emphasized the evolutionary and emergent nature of societies, suggesting that founders can set up environments but should allow organic development.\n\n10. The importance of creating proper incentive structures was discussed, with the acknowledgment that human nature responds to incentives while avoiding purely negative reinforcement."
